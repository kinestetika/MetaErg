            <td id=al>cd01339 L-lactate dehydrogenase-like malate dehydrogenase proteins. Members of this subfamily have an LDH-like structure and an MDH enzymatic activity. Some members, like MJ0490 from Methanococcus jannaschii, exhibit both MDH and LDH activities. Tetrameric MDHs, including those from phototrophic bacteria, are more similar to LDHs than to other MDHs. LDH catalyzes the last step of glycolysis in which pyruvate is converted to L-lactate. MDH is one of the key enzymes in the citric acid cycle, facilitating both the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate and replenishing levels of oxalacetate by reductive carboxylation of pyruvate. The LDH-like MDHs are part of the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily, which includes a wide variety of protein families including the NAD(P)-binding domains of alcohol dehydrogenases, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, formate/glycerate dehydrogenases, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, aminoacid dehydrogenases, repressor rex, and NAD-binding potassium channel domains, among others.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00300 L-lactate dehydrogenase-like enzymes. Members of this subfamily are tetrameric NAD-dependent 2-hydroxycarboxylate dehydrogenases including LDHs, L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenases (L-HicDH), and LDH-like malate dehydrogenases (MDH). Dehydrogenases catalyze the conversion of carbonyl compounds to alcohols or amino acids. LDHs catalyze the last step of glycolysis in which pyruvate is converted to L-lactate. Vertebrate LDHs are non-allosteric, but some bacterial LDHs are activated by an allosteric effector such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. L-HicDH catalyzes the conversion of a variety of 2-oxo carboxylic acids with medium-sized aliphatic or aromatic side chains. MDH is one of the key enzymes in the citric acid cycle, facilitating both the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate and replenishing levels of oxalacetate by reductive carboxylation of pyruvate. The LDH-like subfamily is part of the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily, which includes a wide variety of protein families including the NAD(P)-binding domains of alcohol dehydrogenases, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, formate/glycerate dehydrogenases, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, aminoacid dehydrogenases, repressor rex, and NAD-binding potassium channel domains, among others.</td>

L-2-hydroxyisocapronate dehydrogenase (HicDH) catalyzes the conversion of a variety of 2-oxo carboxylic acids with medium-sized aliphatic or aromatic side chains. This subfamily is composed of HicDHs and some bacterial L-lactate dehydrogenases (LDH). LDHs catalyze the last step of glycolysis in which pyruvate is converted to L-lactate. Bacterial LDHs can be non-allosteric or may be activated by an allosteric effector such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Members of this subfamily with known structures such as the HicDH of Lactobacillus confusus, the non-allosteric LDH of Lactobacillus pentosus, and the allosteric LDH of Bacillus stearothermophilus, show that they exist as homotetramers. The HicDH-like subfamily is part of the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily, which includes a wide variety of protein families including the NAD(P)-binding domains of alcohol dehydrogenases, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, formate/glycerate dehydrogenases, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, aminoacid dehydrogenases, repressor rex, and NAD-binding potassium channel domains, among others.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05294 A lactate dehydrogenases-like structure with malate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity. The LDH-like MDH proteins have a lactate dehyhydrogenase-like (LDH-like) structure and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) enzymatic activity. This subgroup is composed of some archaeal LDH-like MDHs that prefer NADP(H) rather than NAD(H) as a cofactor. One member, MJ0490 from Methanococcus jannaschii, has been observed to form dimers and tetramers during crystalization, although it is believed to exist primarilly as a tetramer in solution. In addition to its MDH activity, MJ0490 also possesses fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-activated LDH activity. Members of this subgroup have a higher sequence similarity to LDHs than to other MDHs. LDH catalyzes the last step of glycolysis in which pyruvate is converted to L-lactate.

MDH is one of the key enzymes in the citric acid cycle, facilitating both the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate and replenishing levels of oxalacetate by reductive carboxylation of pyruvate. Members of this subfamily are eukaryotic MDHs localized to the cytoplasm and cytosol. MDHs are part of the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily, which includes a wide variety of protein families including the NAD(P)-binding domains of alcohol dehydrogenases, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, formate/glycerate dehydrogenases, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, aminoacid dehydrogenases, repressor rex, and NAD-binding potassium channel domains, among others.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR01757 malate dehydrogenase, NADP-dependent. This model represents the NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase found in plants, mosses and green algae and localized to the chloroplast. Malate dehydrogenase converts oxaloacetate into malate, a critical step in the C4 cycle which allows circumvention of the effects of photorespiration. Malate is subsequenctly transported from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm (and then to the bundle sheath cells in C4 plants). The plant and moss enzymes are light regulated via cysteine disulfide bonds. The enzyme from Sorghum has been crystallized.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR01756 lactate dehydrogenase. This model represents a family of protist lactate dehydrogenases which have aparrently evolved from a recent protist malate dehydrogenase ancestor. Lactate dehydrogenase converts the hydroxyl at C-2 of lactate to a carbonyl in the product, pyruvate. The preference of this enzyme for NAD or NADP has not been determined. A critical residue in malate dehydrogenase, arginine-91 (T. vaginalis numbering) has been mutated to a leucine, eliminating the positive charge which complemeted the carboxylate in malate which is absent in lactate. Several other more subtle changes are proposed to make the active site smaller to accomadate the less bulky lactate molecule.</td>
