            <td id=al>cd08300 class III alcohol dehydrogenases. Members identified as glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase(FDH), a member of the zinc dependent/medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.  FDH converts formaldehyde and NAD(P) to formate and NAD(P)H. The initial step in this process the spontaneous formation of a S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione adduct from formaldehyde and glutathione, followed by FDH-mediated oxidation (and detoxification) of the adduct to S-formylglutathione.  MDH family uses NAD(H) as a cofactor in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes or ketones. Like many zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase family (MDR), these FDHs form dimers, with 4 zinc ions per dimer. The medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR) have a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The N-terminal region typically has an all-beta catalytic domain. These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.   ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which have a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide.  A GxGxxG motif after the first mononucleotide contact half allows the close contact of the coenzyme with the ADH backbone.  The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology  to GroES.  These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria),  and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.  NAD(H)  binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic  and coenzyme-binding domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR02818 S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase/class III alcohol dehydrogenase. The members of this protein family show dual function. First, they remove formaldehyde, a toxic metabolite, by acting as S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase (1.1.1.284). S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione can form spontaneously from formaldehyde and glutathione, and so this enzyme previously was designated glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. These same proteins are also designated alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) of class III, for activities that do not require glutathione; they tend to show poor activity for ethanol among their various substrate alcohols.

            <td id=al>cd08277 Liver alcohol dehydrogenase. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.  There are 7 vertebrate ADH 7 classes, 6 of which have been identified in humans. Class III, glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, has been identified as the primordial form and exists in diverse species, including plants, micro-organisms, vertebrates, and invertebrates. Class I, typified by  liver dehydrogenase, is an evolving form. Gene duplication and functional specialization of ADH into ADH classes and subclasses created numerous forms in vertebrates.  For example, the A, B and C (formerly alpha, beta, gamma) human class I subunits have high overall structural similarity, but differ in the substrate binding pocket and therefore in substrate specificity. In human ADH catalysis, the zinc ion helps coordinate the alcohol, followed by deprotonation of  a histidine (His-51), the ribose of NAD,  a serine (Ser-48) , then the alcohol, which allows the transfer of a hydride to NAD+, creating NADH and a zinc-bound aldehyde or ketone. In yeast and some bacteria, the active site zinc binds an aldehyde, polarizing it, and leading to the reverse reaction. ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of an beta-alpha form. The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide.

A GxGxxG motif after the first mononucleotide contact half allows the close contact of the coenzyme with the ADH backbone.  The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology to GroES.  These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.  NAD(H)-binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic  and coenzyme-binding domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding. In human ADH catalysis, the zinc ion helps coordinate the alcohol, followed by deprotonation of  a histidine, the ribose of NAD, a serine, then the alcohol, which allows the transfer of a hydride to NAD+, creating NADH and a zinc-bound aldehyde or ketone. In yeast and some bacteria, the active site zinc binds an aldehyde, polarizing it, and leading to the reverse reaction.</td>

The medium chain reductase/dehydrogenases (MDR)/zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase-like family, which contains the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-Zn) and related proteins, is a diverse group of proteins related to the first identified member, class I mammalian ADH.  MDRs display a broad range of activities and are distinguished from the smaller short chain dehydrogenases  (~ 250 amino acids vs. the ~ 350 amino acids of the MDR).  The MDR proteins have 2 domains: a C-terminal NAD(P) binding-Rossmann fold domain of a beta-alpha form and an N-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to GroES.  The MDR group contains a host of activities, including the founding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) , quinone reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, butanediol DH, ketose reductase, cinnamyl reductase, and numerous others. The zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the NAD(P)(H)-dependent interconversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. ADH-like proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and generally have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain. The active site zinc is coordinated by a histidine, two cysteines, and a water molecule. The second zinc seems to play a structural role, affects subunit interactions, and is typically coordinated by 4 cysteines. Other MDR members have only a catalytic zinc, and some contain no coordinated zinc.</td>

The medium chain dehydrogenases/reductase (MDR)/zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase-like family, which contains the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-Zn) and related proteins, is a diverse group of proteins related to the first identified member, class I mammalian ADH.  MDRs display a broad range of activities and are distinguished from the smaller short chain dehydrogenases (~ 250 amino acids vs. the ~ 350 amino acids of the MDR).  The MDR proteins have 2 domains: a C-terminal NAD(P) binding-Rossmann fold domain of a beta-alpha form and an N-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to GroES.  The MDR group contains a host of activities, including the founding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), quinone reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, butanediol DH, ketose reductase, cinnamyl reductase, and numerous others. The zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the NAD(P)(H)-dependent interconversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.  Active site zinc has a catalytic role, while structural zinc aids in stability.  ADH-like proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and generally have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit. The active site zinc is coordinated by a histidine, two cysteines, and a water molecule. The second zinc seems to play a structural role, affects subunit interactions, and is typically coordinated by 4 cysteines.</td>

This group is predominated by atypical alcohol dehydrogenases; they exist as tetramers and exhibit specificity for NADP(H) as a cofactor in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones.  Like other zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase family (MDR), tetrameric ADHs have a catalytic zinc that resides between the catalytic and NAD(H)binding domains; however, they do not have and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.  The medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR) has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The N-terminal region typically has an all-beta catalytic domain. These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05284 D-arabinose dehydrogenase. This group contains arabinose dehydrogenase (AraDH) and related alcohol dehydrogenases. AraDH is a member of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family and catalyzes the NAD(P)-dependent oxidation of D-arabinose and other pentoses, the initial step in the metabolism of d-arabinose into 2-oxoglutarate. Like the alcohol dehydrogenases, AraDH binds a zinc in the catalytic cleft as well as a distal structural zinc. AraDH forms homotetramers as a dimer of dimers. AraDH replaces a conserved catalytic His with replace with Arg, compared to the canonical ADH site. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.  ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide.  A GxGxxG motif after the first mononucleotide contact half allows the close contact of the coenzyme with the ADH backbone.  The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology to GroES.  These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.  NAD(H) binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic and coenzyme-binding domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding. In human ADH catalysis, the zinc ion helps coordinate the alcohol, followed by deprotonation of a histidine, the ribose of NAD, a serine, then the alcohol, which allows the transfer of a hydride to NAD+, creating NADH and a zinc-bound aldehyde or ketone. In yeast and some bacteria, the active site zinc binds an aldehyde, polarizing it, and leading to the reverse reaction.</td>

This group contains proteins identified as alcohol dehydrogenases and glutathione-dependant formaldehyde dehydrogenases (FDH) of the zinc-dependent/medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.  The MDR family uses NAD(H) as a cofactor in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones.  FDH converts formaldehyde and NAD to formate and NADH. The initial step in this process the spontaneous formation of a S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione adduct from formaldehyde and glutathione, followed by FDH-mediated oxidation (and detoxification) of the adduct to S-formylglutathione. The medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR) has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The N-terminal region typically has an all-beta catalytic domain.

The MDR proteins have 2 domains: a C-terminal NAD(P) binding-Rossmann fold domain of a beta-alpha form and an N-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to GroES.  The MDR group contains a host of activities, including the founding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHs), quinone reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, butanediol DH, ketose reductase, cinnamyl reductase, and numerous others. The zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the  NAD(P)(H)-dependent interconversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.  Active site zinc has a catalytic role, while structural zinc aids in stability.  ADH-like proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and generally have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit. The active site zinc is coordinated by a histidine, two cysteines, and a water molecule. The second zinc seems to play a structural role, affects subunit interactions, and is typically coordinated by 4 cysteines.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08282 Pseudomonas putida aldehyde-dismutating formaldehyde dehydrogenase (PFDH). Formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) is a member of the zinc-dependent/medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.  Unlike typical FDH, Pseudomonas putida aldehyde-dismutating FDH (PFDH) is glutathione-independent.  PFDH converts 2 molecules of aldehydes to corresponding carboxylic acid and alcohol.  MDH family uses NAD(H) as a cofactor in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones. Like the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase family (MDR), these tetrameric FDHs have a catalytic zinc that resides between the catalytic and NAD(H)binding domains and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain. Unlike ADH, where NAD(P)(H) acts as a cofactor, NADH in FDH is a tightly bound redox cofactor (similar to nicotinamide proteins).  The medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR) has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of an beta-alpha form. The N-terminal region typically has an all-beta catalytic domain. These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit.</td>

This group is related to formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH), which  is a member of the zinc-dependent/medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.  This family uses NAD(H) as a cofactor in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones. Another member is identified as a dihydroxyacetone reductase. Like the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase family (MDR), tetrameric FDHs have a catalytic zinc that resides between the catalytic and NAD(H)binding domains and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.

            <td id=al>cd08249 enoyl_reductase_like. Member identified as possible enoyl reductase of the MDR family. 2-enoyl thioester reductase (ETR) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent dependent conversion of trans-2-enoyl acyl carrier protein/coenzyme A (ACP/CoA) to acyl-(ACP/CoA) in fatty acid synthesis. 2-enoyl thioester reductase activity has been linked in  Candida tropicalis as essential in maintaining mitiochondrial respiratory function. This ETR family is a part of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, but lack the zinc coordination sites characteristic of the alcohol dehydrogenases in this family. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.  ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide.  The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology to GroES.  These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site, and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.  NAD(H)-binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic  and coenzyme-binding domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding.  Candida tropicalis enoyl thioester reductase (Etr1p) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of trans-2-enoyl thioesters in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. Etr1p forms homodimers with each subunit containing a nucleotide-binding Rossmann fold domain and a catalytic domain.</td>
