            <td id=al>cd00710 Gamma carbonic anhydrases (CA): Carbonic anhydrases are zinc-containing enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in a two-step mechanism, involving the nucleophilic attack of a zinc-bound hydroxide ion on carbon dioxide, followed by the regeneration of the active site by ionization of the zinc-bound water molecule and removal of a proton from the active site. They are ubiquitous enzymes involved in fundamental processes like photosynthesis, respiration, pH homeostasis and ion transport. There are three distinct groups of  carbonic anhydrases - alpha, beta and gamma - which show no significant sequence identity or structural similarity. Gamma CAs are homotrimeric enzymes, with each subunit containing a left-handed parallel beta helix (LbH) structural domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00307 Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), small subunit and related proteins. Rubisco is a bifunctional enzyme catalyzes the initial steps of two opposing metabolic pathways: photosynthetic carbon fixation and the competing process of photorespiration. Rubisco Form I, present in plants and green algae, is composed of eight large and eight small subunits. The nearly identical small subunits are encoded by a family of nuclear genes. After translation, the small subunits are translocated across the chloroplast membrane, where an N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved off. While the large subunits contain the catalytic activities, it has been shown that the small subunits are important for catalysis by enhancing the catalytic rate through inducing conformational changes in the large subunits. This superfamily also contains specific proteins from cyanobacteria. CcmM plays a role in a CO2 concentrating mechanism, which cyanobacteria need to to overcome the low specificity of their Rubisco and fusions to Rubisco activase, a type of chaperone, which promotes and maintains the catalytic activity of Rubisco. CcmM contains an N-terminal carbonic anhydrase fused to four copies of the Rubisco-small subunit domain</td>

            <td id=al>smart00961 Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, small chain. RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyses both the carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), thus fixing carbon dioxide as the first step of the Calvin cycle. RuBisCO is the major protein in the stroma of chloroplasts, and in higher plants exists as a complex of 8 large and 8 small subunits. The function of the small subunit is unknown. While the large subunit is coded for by a single gene, the small subunit is coded for by several different genes, which are distributed in a tissue specific manner. They are transcriptionally regulated by light receptor phytochrome. which results in RuBisCO being more abundant during the day when it is required.</td>

Proteins in this group are expected to adopt the left-handed parallel beta-helix (LbH) structure. They contain imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X). Similarity to gamma carbonic anhydrase and Ferripyochelin Binding Protein (FBP) may suggest metal binding capacity.</td>

It adopts the left-handed parallel beta-helix (LbH) structure, and contains imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X). Proteins containing hexapeptide repeats are often enzymes showing acyltransferase activity. Acyltransferase activity has not been observed in this group.</td>
