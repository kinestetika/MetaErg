            <td id=al>cd14498 dual-specificity phosphatase domain. The dual-specificity phosphatase domain is found in typical and atypical dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), which function as protein-serine/threonine phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.16) and protein-tyrosine-phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.48). Typical DUSPs, also called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs), deactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating the threonine and tyrosine residues in the conserved Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif residing in their activation sites. All MKPs contain an N-terminal Cdc25/rhodanese-like domain, which is responsible for MAPK-binding, and a C-terminal catalytic dual specificity phosphatase domain. Atypical DUSPs contain the catalytic dual specificity phosphatase domain but lack the N-terminal Cdc25/rhodanese-like domain that is present in typical DUSPs or MKPs. Also included in this family are dual specificity phosphatase-like domains of catalytically inactive members such as serine/threonine/tyrosine-interacting protein (STYX) and serine/threonine/tyrosine interacting like 1 (STYXL1), as well as active phosphatases with substrates that are not phosphoproteins such as PTP localized to the mitochondrion 1 (PTPMT1), which is a lipid phosphatase, and laforin, which is a glycogen phosphatase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd14524 protein-tyrosine phosphatase mitochondrial 1. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase mitochondrial 1 or PTP localized to the mitochondrion 1 (PTPMT1), also called phosphoinositide lipid phosphatase (PLIP), phosphatidylglycerophosphatase and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1, or PTEN-like phosphatase, is a lipid phosphatase or phosphatidylglycerophosphatase (EC 3.1.3.27) which dephosphorylates phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) to phosphatidylglycerol (PG). It is targeted to the mitochondrion by an N-terminal signal sequence and is found anchored to the matrix face of the inner membrane. It is essential for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid regulating the membrane integrity and activities of the organelle. PTPMT1 also plays a crucial role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, and has been shown to display activity  toward phosphoprotein substrates.</td>

            <td id=al>cd14567 dual specificity phosphatase domain of dual specificity protein phosphatase 10. Dual specificity protein phosphatase 10 (DUSP10), also called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 5 (MKP-5), functions as a protein-serine/threonine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.16) and a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.48). Like other MKPs, it deactivates its MAPK substrates by dephosphorylating the threonine and tyrosine residues in the conserved Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif residing in their activation sites. It belongs to the class III subfamily and is a JNK/p38-selective cytoplasmic MKP. DUSP10/MKP-5 coordinates skeletal muscle regeneration by negatively regulating mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. It is also an important regulator of intestinal epithelial barrier function and a suppressor of colon tumorigenesis. DUSP10/MKP-5 contains an N-terminal Cdc25/rhodanese-like domain, which is responsible for MAPK-binding, and a C-terminal catalytic dual specificity phosphatase domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd14566 dual specificity phosphatase domain of class II mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) are eukaryotic dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that act on MAPKs and function as a protein-serine/threonine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.16) and a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.48). They deactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating the threonine and tyrosine residues in the conserved Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif residing in their activation sites. Based on sequence homology, subcellular localization and substrate specificity, 10 MKPs can be subdivided into three subfamilies (class I-III). Class II MKPs consist of DUSP6/MKP-3, DUSP7/MKP-X and DUSP9/MKP-4, and are ERK-selective cytoplasmic MKPs. All MKPs contain an N-terminal Cdc25/rhodanese-like domain, which is responsible for MAPK-binding, and a C-terminal catalytic dual specificity phosphatase domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd14512 dual specificity phosphatase domain of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) are eukaryotic dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that act on MAPKs, which are involved in gene regulation, cell proliferation, programmed cell death and stress responses, as an important feedback control mechanism that limits MAPK cascades. MKPs, also referred to as typical DUSPs, function as a protein-serine/threonine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.16) and a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.48). They deactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating the threonine and tyrosine residues in the conserved Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif residing in their activation sites.

All MKPs contain an N-terminal Cdc25/rhodanese-like domain, which is responsible for MAPK-binding, and a C-terminal catalytic dual specificity phosphatase domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd14582 dual specificity phosphatase domain of dual specificity protein phosphatase 15. Dual specificity protein phosphatase 15 (DUSP15), also called Vaccinia virus VH1-related dual-specific protein phosphatase Y (VHY) or VH1-related member Y, functions as a protein-serine/threonine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.16) and a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.48). DUSP15 is an atypical DUSP; it contains the catalytic dual specificity phosphatase domain but lacks the N-terminal Cdc25/rhodanese-like domain that is present in typical DUSPs or MKPs. It is highly expressed in the testis and is located in the plasma membrane in a myristoylation-dependent manner. It may be involved in the regulation of meiotic signal transduction in testis cells. It is also expressed in the brain and has been identified as a regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation. DUSP15 contains an N-terminal catalytic dual specificity phosphatase domain and a short C-terminal tail.</td>
