Members of this protein family are ABC transporter substrate-binding proteins associated with urea transport and metabolism. This protein is found in a conserved five-gene transport operon typically found adjacent to urease genes. It was shown in Cyanobacteria that disruption leads to the loss of high-affinity urea transport activity. Members of this protein family tend to have the twin-arginine signal for Sec-independent transport across the plasma membrane. [Transport and binding proteins, Amino acids, peptides and amines]</td>

FmdD, a type 1 periplasmic binding protein, is induced by short-chain amides and urea and repressed by excess ammonia, while FmdE and FmdF are hydrophobic transmembrane proteins. FmdDEF is predicted to be an ATP-dependent transporter and closely resembles the periplasmic binding protein and the two transmembrane proteins present in various hydrophobic amino acid-binding transport systems.</td>

AmiC controls expression of the amidase operon by the ligand-triggered conformational switch. In the absence of ligand or presence of butyramide (repressor), AmiC (the ligand sensor and negative regulator) adopts an open conformation and inhibits the transcription antitermination function of AmiR by direct protein-protein interaction. In the presence of inducing ligands such as acetamide, AmiC adopts a closed conformation which disrupts a silencing AmiC-AmiR complex and the expression of amidase and other genes of the operon are induced.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06358 type 1 periplasmic-binding protein of the nitrile hydratase (NHase) system that selectively converts nitriles to corresponding amides. This group includes the type 1 periplasmic-binding protein of the nitrile hydratase (NHase) system that selectively converts nitriles to corresponding amides, which are subsequently converted by amidases to yield free carboxylic acids and ammonia. NHases from bacteria and fungi have been purified and characterized. In Rhodococcus sp., the nitrile hydratase operon consists of six genes encoding NHase regulator 2, NHase regulator 1, amidase, NHase alpha subunit, NHase beta subunit, and NHase activator. The operon produces a constitutive hydratase that has a broad substrate spectrum: aliphatic and aromatic nitriles, mononitriles and dinitriles, hydroxynitriles and amino-nitriles, and a constitutive amidase of equally low substrate specificity. NHases are metalloenzymes containing either cobalt or iron, and therefore can be classified into two subgroups: ferric NHases and cobalt NHases.</td>

However, they closely resemble the group of AmiC and active transport systems for short-chain amides and urea (FmdDEF), and thus are likely to exhibit a ligand-binding mode similar to that of the amide sensor protein AmiC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, this binding domain has high sequence identity to the family of hydrophobic amino acid transporters (HAAT), and thus it may also be involved in transport of amino acids.</td>

Members of this subgroup include proteins from Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans, which is resistant to arsenic (As) and various heavy metals such as cadmium and zinc. Moreover, they show significant sequence similarity to the cluster of AmiC and active transport systems for short-chain amides and urea (FmdDEF), and thus are likely to exhibit a ligand-binding mode similar to that of the amide sensor protein AmiC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</td>

Periplasmic binding domain of ATP-binding cassette transporter-like systems that belong to the type 1 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily. They are mostly present in archaea and eubacteria, and are primarily involved in scavenging solutes from the environment. ABC-type transporters couple ATP hydrolysis with the uptake and efflux of a wide range of substrates across bacterial membranes, including amino acids, peptides, lipids and sterols, and various drugs. These systems are comprised of transmembrane domains, nucleotide binding domains, and in most bacterial uptake systems, periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) which transfer the ligand to the extracellular gate of the transmembrane domains. These PBPs bind their substrates selectively and with high affinity. Members of this group include ABC-type Leucine-Isoleucine-Valine-Binding Proteins (LIVBP), which are homologous to the aliphatic amidase transcriptional repressor, AmiC, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The uncharacterized periplasmic components of various ABC-type transport systems are included in this group.</td>

            <td id=al>cd20378 periplasmic substrate-binding domain of active transport proteins. Periplasmic substrate-binding domain of active transport proteins found in bacteria and Archaea. Members of this group are initial receptors in the process of active transport across cellular membrane, but their substrate specificities are not known in detail. However, they closely resemble the group of AmiC and active transport systems for short-chain amides and urea (FmdDEF), and thus are likely to exhibit a ligand-binding mode similar to that of the amide sensor protein AmiC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, this binding domain has high sequence identity to the family of hydrophobic amino acid transporters (HAAT), and thus it may also be involved in transport of amino acids.</td>
