            <td id=al>Substrate binding domain of ferric iron-binding protein, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold superfamily. FutA1 is the periplasmic component of an ABC-type iron transporter and serves as the primary receptor in Synerchosystis species. The periplasmic iron binding protein plays an essential role in the iron uptake pathway of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and is critical for survival of these pathogens within the host. After binding iron with high affinity, FutA1 interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. The iron- and thiamine-binding proteins belong to the PBPI2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge. They have been shown to bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>

            <td id=al>The periplasmic-binding component of an uncharacterized ABC transport system from Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009 and related proteins; contains the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold. This group represents the periplasmic binding domain that serves as the primary high-affinity receptor of an uncharacterized ABC-type polyamine transporter from Rhodopseudomonas palustris Cga009 and related proteins from other bacteria. Polyamine transport plays an essential role in the regulation of intracellular polyamine levels which are known to be elevated in rapidly proliferating cells and tumors. Natural polyamines are putrescine, spermindine, and spermine. They are polycations that play multiple roles in cell growth, survival and proliferation, and plant stress and disease resistance. They can interact with negatively charged molecules, such as nucleic acids, to modulate their functions. Members of this family belong to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold superfamily. PBP2 is comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>

            <td id=al>Substrate binding domain of thiamin transporter, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold superfamily. Thiamin-binding protein TbpA is the periplasmic component of ABC-type transporter in E. coli, while the transmembrane permease and ATPase are ThiP and ThiQ, respectively. Thiamin (vitamin B1) is an essential confactor in all living systems that  most prokaryotes, plants, and fungi can synthesized thiamin. However,  in vertebrates, thiamine cannot be synthesized and must therefore be obtained through dietary absorption.  In addition to thiamin biosynthesis, most organisms can import thiamin using specific transporters. After binding thiamine with high affinity, TbpA interacts with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. The thiamine-binding proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge.
