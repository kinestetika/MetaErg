            <td id=al>formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase. This model describes formyltetrahydrofolate deformylases. The enzyme is a homohexamer. Sequences from a related enzyme formyl tetrahydrofolate-specific enzyme, phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase, serve as an outgroup for phylogenetic analysis. Putative members of this family, scoring below the trusted cutoff, include a sequence from Rhodobacter capsulatus that lacks an otherwise conserved C-terminal region.

            <td id=al>Formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase (Formyl-FH4 hydrolase), C-terminal hydrolase domain. Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-FH4) to FH4 and formate. Formate is the substrate of phosphoribosylglycinamide transformylase for step three of de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Formyl-FH4 hydrolase has been proposed to regulate the balance of FH4 and C1-FH4 in the cell.  The enzyme uses methionine and glycine to sense the pools of C1-FH4 and FH4, respectively. This domain belongs to the formyltransferase (FMT) domain superfamily. Members of this family have an N-terminal ACT domain, which is  commonly involved in specifically bind an amino acid or other small ligand leading to regulation of the enzyme. The N-terminal of this protein family may be responsible for the binding of the regulators methionine and glycine.</td>

            <td id=al>Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GAR transformylase, GART). Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase, also known as GAR transformylase or GART, is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the third step in de novo purine biosynthesis. This enzyme uses formyl tetrahydrofolate as a formyl group donor to produce 5'-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide. In prokaryotes, GART is a single domain protein but in most eukaryotes it is the C-terminal portion of a large multifunctional protein which also contains GAR synthetase and aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase activities.</td>

            <td id=al>Formyl transferase. This family includes the following members. Glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase catalyzes the third step in de novo purine biosynthesis, the transfer of a formyl group to 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide. Formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase produces formate from formyl- tetrahydrofolate. Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase transfers a formyl group onto the amino terminus of the acyl moiety of the methionyl aminoacyl-tRNA. Inclusion of the following members is supported by PSI-blast. HOXX_BRAJA (P31907) contains a related domain of unknown function. PRTH_PORGI (P46071) contains a related domain of unknown function. Y09P_MYCTU (Q50721) contains a related domain of unknown function.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase, formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent. This model describes phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GAR transformylase), one of several proteins in formyl_transf (pfam00551). This enzyme uses formyl tetrahydrofolate as a formyl group donor to produce 5'-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide. PurT, a different GAR transformylase, uses ATP and formate rather than formyl tetrahydrofolate. Experimental proof includes complementation of E. coli purN mutants by orthologs from vertebrates (where it is a domain of a multifunctional protein), Bacillus subtilis, and Arabidopsis. No archaeal example was detected. In phylogenetic analyses, the member from Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows a long branch length but membership in the family, while the formyltetrahydrofolate deformylases form a closely related outgroup.

            <td id=al>Formyltransferase, catalytic core domain. Formyltransferase, catalytic core domain. The proteins of this superfamily contain a formyltransferase domain that hydrolyzes the removal of a formyl group from its substrate as part of a multistep transfer mechanism, and this alignment model represents the catalytic core of the formyltransferase domain.  This family includes the following known members; Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase (GART), Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase, Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase, ArnA, and 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (FDH).  Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase  (GART) catalyzes the third step in de novo purine biosynthesis, the transfer of a formyl group to 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide. Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-FH4) to FH4 and formate. Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase transfers a formyl group onto the amino terminus of the acyl moiety of the methionyl aminoacyl-tRNA, which plays important role in translation initiation. ArnA is required for the modification of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (Ara4N) that leads to resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and clinical antimicrobials such as polymyxin. 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, a precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis, to tetrahydrofolate. Members of this family are multidomain proteins. The formyltransferase domain is located at the N-terminus of FDH, Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase and ArnA, and at the C-terminus of Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase.  Prokaryotic Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase (GART) is a single domain protein while eukaryotic GART is a trifunctional protein that catalyzes the second, third and fifth steps in de novo purine biosynthesis.</td>

This CD includes the N-terminal ACT domain of formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase (F4HF-DF; formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase) which catalyzes the hydrolysis of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-FH4) to FH4 and formate. Formyl-FH4 hydrolase  generates the formate that is used by purT-encoded 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide transformylase for step three of de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Formyl-FH4 hydrolase, a hexamer which is activated by methionine and inhibited by glycine, is proposed to regulate the balance FH4 and C1-FH4 in response to changing growth conditions. Members of this CD belong to the superfamily of ACT regulatory domains.</td>

            <td id=al>Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase, N-terminal hydrolase domain. Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (Met-tRNA-FMT), N-terminal formyltransferase domain.  Met-tRNA-FMT transfers a formyl group from N-10 formyltetrahydrofolate to the amino terminal end of a methionyl-aminoacyl-tRNA acyl moiety, yielding formyl-Met-tRNA. Formyl-Met-tRNA plays essential role in protein translation initiation by forming complex with IF2. The formyl group plays a dual role in the initiator identity of N-formylmethionyl-tRNA by promoting its recognition by IF2 and by impairing its binding to EFTU-GTP.  The N-terminal domain contains a Rossmann fold and it is the catalytic domain of the enzyme.</td>

            <td id=al>ArnA, N-terminal formyltransferase domain. ArnA_N:  ArnA is a bifunctional enzyme required for the modification of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (Ara4N) that leads to resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and clinical antimicrobials such as polymyxin.  The C-terminal dehydrogenase domain of ArnA catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) to UDP-4-keto-arabinose (UDP-Ara4O), while the N-terminal formyltransferase domain of ArnA catalyzes the addition of a formyl group to UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (UDP-L-Ara4N) to form UDP-L-4-formamido-arabinose (UDP-L-Ara4FN). This domain family represents the catalytic core of the N-terminal formyltransferase domain. The formyltransferase also contains a smaller C-terminal domain the may be  involved in substrate binding. ArnA forms a hexameric structure, in which the dehydrogenase domains are arranged at the center of the particle with the transformylase domains on the outside of the particle.</td>
