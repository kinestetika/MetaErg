            <td id=al>pfam00885 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase. This family includes the beta chain of 6,7-dimethyl-8- ribityllumazine synthase EC:2.5.1.9, an enzyme involved in riboflavin biosynthesis. The family also includes a subfamily of distant archaebacterial proteins that may also have the same function. The family contains a number of different subsets including a family of proteins comprising archaeal lumazine and riboflavin synthases, type I lumazine synthases, and the eubacterial type II lumazine synthases. It has been established that lumazine synthase catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin in plants and microorganisms. The type I lumazine synthases area active in pentameric or icosahedral quaternary assemblies, whereas the type II are decameric. Brucella, a bacterial genus that causes brucellosis, and other Rhizobiales have an atypical riboflavin metabolic pathway. Brucella spp code for both a type-I and a type-II lumazine synthase, and it has been shown that at least one of these two has to be present in order for Brucella to be viable, showing that in the case of Brucella flavin metabolism is implicated in bacterial virulence.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09209 lumazine synthase (6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase, LS), catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2); type-I. Type-I LS, also known as RibH1, catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin in plants and microorganisms. LS catalyse the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine by the condensation of 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione with 3,4-dihydroxy- 2-butanone-4-phosphate. Subsequently, the lumazine intermediate dismutates to yield riboflavin and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino- 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, in a reaction catalyzed by riboflavin synthase synthase (RS); RS belongs to a different family of the Lumazine-synthase-like superfamily. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) which are essential cofactors for the catalysis of a wide range of redox reactions. These cofactors are also involved in many other processes involving DNA repair, circadian time-keeping, light sensing, and bioluminescence. Riboflavin is biosynthesized in plants, fungi and certain microorganisms; as animals lack the necessary enzymes to produce this vitamin, they acquire it from dietary sources. Type II LSs are distinct from type-I LS not only in protein sequence, but in that they exhibit different quaternary assemblies; type-I LSs form pentamers. The pathogen Brucella spp. encode both a Type-I LS and a Type-II LS called RibH1 and RibH2, respectively. RibH1/type-I LS  appears to be the functional LS in Brucella spp., whereas RibH2/type-II LS has much lower catalytic activity as LS. The pathogen Brucella spp. have both a type-I LS and a type-II LS called RibH1 and RibH2, respectively. RibH1/type-I LS appears to be a functional LS in Brucella spp., whereas RibH2/type-II LS has much lower catalytic activity as LS.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR00114 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase. This enzyme catalyzes the cyclo-ligation of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-P and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione to form 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, the immediate precursor of riboflavin. Sometimes referred to as riboflavin synthase, beta subunit, this should not be confused with the alpha subunit which carries out the subsequent reaction. Archaeal members of this family are considered putative, although included in the seed and scoring above the trusted cutoff.

            <td id=al>cd08371 lumazine synthase and riboflavin synthase; involved in the riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthetic pathway. This superfamily contains lumazine synthase (6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase, LS) and riboflavin synthase (RS). Both enzymes play important roles in the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) which are essential cofactors for the catalysis of a wide range of redox reactions. These cofactors are also involved in many other processes involving DNA repair, circadian time-keeping, light sensing, and bioluminescence. Riboflavin is biosynthesized in plants, fungi and certain microorganisms; as animals lack the necessary enzymes to produce this vitamin, they acquire it from dietary sources. In the final steps of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway, LS catalyzes the condensation of the 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione with 3,4-dihydroxy- 2-butanone-4-phosphate to release water, inorganic phosphate and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (DMRL), and RS catalyzes a dismutation of DMRL which yields riboflavin and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione. In the latter reaction, a four-carbon moiety is transferred between two DMRL molecules serving as donor and acceptor, respectively. Both the LS and RS catalyzed reactions are thermodynamically irreversible and can proceed in the absence of a catalyst. In bacteria and eukaryotes, there are two types of LS: type-I LS forms homo-pentamers or icosahedrally arranged dodecamers of pentamers, type-II LS forms decamers (dimers of pentamers). In archaea LSs and RSs appear to have diverged early in the evolution of archaea from a common ancestor.</td>

In the latter reaction, a four-carbon moiety is transferred between two DMRL molecules serving as donor and acceptor, respectively. Both the LS and RS catalyzed reactions are thermodynamically irreversible and can proceed in the absence of a catalyst. LS from Methanococcus jannaschii forms capsids with icosahedral 532 symmetry consisting of 60 subunits. Archaeal LSs share sequence similarity with archaeal RSs, both appear to have diverged early in the evolution of archaea from a common ancestor.</td>
