            <td id=al>Nudix hydrolase is a superfamily of enzymes found in all three kingdoms of life, and it catalyzes the hydrolysis of NUcleoside DIphosphates linked to other moieties, X. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily require a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for their activity. Members of this family are recognized by a highly conserved 23-residue nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), which forms a structural motif that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. Substrates of nudix hydrolase include intact and oxidatively damaged nucleoside triphosphates, dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide-sugars and dinucleotide enzymes. These substrates are metabolites or cell signaling molecules that require regulation during different stages of the cell cycle or during periods of stress. In general, the role of the nudix hydrolase is to sanitize the nucleotide pools and to maintain cell viability, thereby serving as surveillance and "house-cleaning" enzymes. Substrate specificity is used to define child families within the superfamily. Differences in substrate specificity are determined by the N-terminal extension or by residues in variable loop regions. Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in the numbers and roles of divalent cations required. This superfamily consists of at least nine families: IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) isomerase, ADP ribose pyrophosphatase, mutT pyrophosphohydrolase, coenzyme-A pyrophosphatase, MTH1-7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-triphosphatase, diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, NADH pyrophosphatase, GDP-mannose hydrolase and the c-terminal portion of the mutY adenine glycosylase.</td>

            <td id=al>ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose and a variety of additional ADP-sugar conjugates to AMP and ribose-5-phosphate. Like other members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, it requires a divalent cation, such as Mg2+, for its activity. It also contains a highly conserved 23-residue Nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V) which functions as a metal binding site/catalytic site. In addition to the Nudix motif, there are additional conserved amino acid residues, distal from the signature sequence, that correlate with substrate specificity. In humans, there are four distinct ADPRase activities, three putative cytosolic enzymes (ADPRase-I, -II, and -Mn) and a single mitochondrial enzyme (ADPRase-m). Human ADPRase-II is also referred to as NUDT5. It lacks the N-terminal target sequence unique to mitochondrial ADPRase. The different cytosolic types are distinguished by their specificities for substrate and specific requirement for metal ions. NUDT5 forms a homodimer.</td>

            <td id=al>MutT homolog-1 (MTH1) is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. MTH1, the mammalian counterpart of MutT, hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-hydroxy-ATP, to monophosphates, thereby preventing the incorporation of such oxygen radicals during replication. This is an important step in the repair mechanism in genomic and mitochondrial DNA.  Like other members of the Nudix family, it requires a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, for activity, and contain the Nudix motif, a highly conserved 23-residue block (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. MTH1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Structurally, this enzyme adopts a similar fold to MutT despite low sequence similarity outside the conserved nudix motif. The most distinctive structural difference between MutT and MTH1 is the presence of a beta-hairpin, which is absent in MutT. This results in a much deeper and narrower substrate binding pocket. Mechanistically, MTH1 contains dual specificity for nucleotides that contain 2-OH-adenine bases and those that contain 8-oxo-guanine bases.</td>

In general, the role of the nudix hydrolase is to sanitize the nucleotide pools and to maintain cell viability, thereby serving as surveillance & "house-cleaning" enzymes. Substrate specificity is used to define families within the superfamily. Differences in substrate specificity are determined by the N-terminal extension or by residues in variable loop regions. Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in the numbers and roles of divalent cations required.</td>

            <td id=al>Diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) hydrolase is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. Ap4A hydrolases are well represented in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Phylogenetic analysis reveals two distinct subgroups where plant enzymes fall into one subfamily and fungi/animals/archaea enzymes, represented by this subfamily, fall into another. Bacterial enzymes are found in both subfamilies. Ap4A is a potential by-product of aminoacyl tRNA synthesis, and accumulation of Ap4A has been implicated in a range of biological events, such as DNA replication, cellular differentiation, heat shock, metabolic stress, and apoptosis. Ap4A hydrolase cleaves Ap4A asymmetrically into ATP and AMP. It is important in the invasive properties of bacteria and thus presents a potential target for inhibition of such invasive bacteria. Besides the signature nudix motif (G[X5]E[X7]REUXEEXGU, where U is Ile, Leu, or Val) that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site, and a required divalent cation, Ap4A hydrolase is structurally similar to the other members of the nudix superfamily with some degree of variation. Several regions in the sequences are poorly defined and substrate and metal binding sites are only predicted based on kinetic studies.</td>
