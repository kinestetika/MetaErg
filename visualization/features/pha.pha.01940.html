            <td id=al>TIGR03705 polyphosphate kinase 1. Members of this protein family are the enzyme polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1). This family is found in many prokaryotes and also in Dictyostelium. Sequences in the seed alignment were taken from prokaryotic consecutive two-gene pairs in which the other gene encodes an exopolyphosphatase. It synthesizes polyphosphate from the terminal phosphate of ATP but not GTP, in contrast to PPK2. [Central intermediary metabolism, Phosphorus compounds]</td>

            <td id=al>pfam17941 Polyphosphate kinase C-terminal domain 1. Polyphosphate kinase (Ppk) catalyses the formation of polyphosphate from ATP, with chain lengths of up to a thousand or more orthophosphate molecules. This C1-terminal domain has a structure similar to phospholipase D. It is one of two closely related carboxy-terminal domains (C1 and C2 domains). Both the C1 and C2 domains (residues 322-502 and 503-687, respectively) consist of a sevenstranded mixed beta-sheet flanked by five alpha-helices. However, the structural topology and relative orientations of the helices to the beta-sheet in these two domains are different. The C1 and C2 domains are highly conserved in the PPK family. Some of the residues previously shown to be crucial for the enzyme catalytic activity are located in these two domains.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09165 Catalytic C-terminal domain, first repeat, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa polyphosphate kinase 1 and similar proteins. Catalytic C-terminal domain, first repeat (C1 domain), of polyphosphate kinase (Poly P kinase 1 or PPK1, EC 2.7.4.1) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaPPK1), Dictyostelium discoideum (DdPPK1), and other similar proteins. Inorganic polyphosphate (Poly P) plays an important role in bacterial stress responses and stationary-phase survival. PaPPK1 is the key enzyme responsible for the synthesis of Poly P in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It can catalyze the reversible conversion of the terminal-phosphate of ATP to Poly P. PaPPK1 shows high sequence homolog to Escherichia coli polyphosphate kinase (EcPPK), which contains four structural domains per chain: the N-terminal (N) domain, the head (H) domain, and two closely related C-terminal (C1 and C2) domains. The N domain provides the upper binding interface for the adenine ring of the ATP. The H domain is involved in dimerization, while both the C1 and C2 domains contain residues crucial for catalytic activity. The intersection of the N, C1, and C2 domains forms a structural tunnel in which the PPK catalytic reactions are carried out. The polyphosphate kinase from Dictyostelium discoideum (DdPPK1) shares similar structural features with EcPPK1 in the ATP-binding pocket and poly P tunnel, but has a unique N-terminal extension that may be responsible for its enzymatic activity, cellular localization, and physiological functions. In spite of the lack of sequence homology, the C1 and C2 domains of the family members are structurally similar to the two repetitive catalytic domains of phospholipase D (PLD). Moreover, some residues in the HKD motif (H-x-K-x(4)-D, where x represents any amino acid residue) of the PLD superfamily are spatially conserved in the active site of PPK1. It is possible that the bacterial PPK1 family and the PLD family have a common ancestor and diverged early in evolution. In some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a second enzyme, PPK2, which is involved in the alternative pathway of polyphosphate synthesis, has been found. It can catalyze the synthesis of poly P from GTP or ATP, with a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+. PPK2 shows no sequence similarity to PPK1 and belongs to a different superfamily.</td>

Dimerization is crucial for the enzymatic activity of PPK1. The prototype of this subfamily is Escherichia coli polyphosphate kinase (EcPPK), which forms a homotetramer in solution, and becomes a homodimer upon the binding of AMPPNP, a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue. Each EcPPK monomer includes four structural domains, the N-terminal (N) domain, the head (H) domain, and two closely related C-terminal (C1 and C2)domains.

The intersection of the N, C1, and C2 domains forms a structural tunnel in which the PPK catalytic reactions are carried out. In spite of the lack of sequence homology, the C1 and C2 domains of PPK1 are structurally similar to the two repetitive catalytic domains of phospholipase D (PLD). Moreover, some residues in the HKD motif (H-x-K-x(4)-D, where x represents any amino acid residue) of the PLD superfamily are spatially conserved in the active site of PPK1. It is possible that the bacterial PPK1 family and the PLD family have a common ancestor and diverged early in evolution. There is a second bacterial-type enzyme, PPK2, which is involved in the synthesis of poly P from GTP or ATP. PPK2 shows no sequence similarity to PPK1 and belongs to different superfamily.</td>
