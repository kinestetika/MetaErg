Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase, also known as GAR transformylase or GART, is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the third step in de novo purine biosynthesis. This enzyme uses formyl tetrahydrofolate as a formyl group donor to produce 5'-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide. In prokaryotes, GART is a single domain protein but in most eukaryotes it is the C-terminal portion of a large multifunctional protein which also contains GAR synthetase and aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase activities.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR00639 phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase, formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent. This model describes phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GAR transformylase), one of several proteins in formyl_transf (pfam00551). This enzyme uses formyl tetrahydrofolate as a formyl group donor to produce 5'-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide. PurT, a different GAR transformylase, uses ATP and formate rather than formyl tetrahydrofolate. Experimental proof includes complementation of E. coli purN mutants by orthologs from vertebrates (where it is a domain of a multifunctional protein), Bacillus subtilis, and Arabidopsis. No archaeal example was detected. In phylogenetic analyses, the member from Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows a long branch length but membership in the family, while the formyltetrahydrofolate deformylases form a closely related outgroup.

            <td id=al>cd08369 Formyltransferase, catalytic core domain. Formyltransferase, catalytic core domain. The proteins of this superfamily contain a formyltransferase domain that hydrolyzes the removal of a formyl group from its substrate as part of a multistep transfer mechanism, and this alignment model represents the catalytic core of the formyltransferase domain.  This family includes the following known members; Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase (GART), Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase, Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase, ArnA, and 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (FDH).  Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase  (GART) catalyzes the third step in de novo purine biosynthesis, the transfer of a formyl group to 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide. Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-FH4) to FH4 and formate. Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase transfers a formyl group onto the amino terminus of the acyl moiety of the methionyl aminoacyl-tRNA, which plays important role in translation initiation. ArnA is required for the modification of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (Ara4N) that leads to resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and clinical antimicrobials such as polymyxin. 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, a precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis, to tetrahydrofolate. Members of this family are multidomain proteins. The formyltransferase domain is located at the N-terminus of FDH, Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase and ArnA, and at the C-terminus of Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase.  Prokaryotic Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase (GART) is a single domain protein while eukaryotic GART is a trifunctional protein that catalyzes the second, third and fifth steps in de novo purine biosynthesis.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08648 Formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase (Formyl-FH4 hydrolase), C-terminal hydrolase domain. Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-FH4) to FH4 and formate. Formate is the substrate of phosphoribosylglycinamide transformylase for step three of de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Formyl-FH4 hydrolase has been proposed to regulate the balance of FH4 and C1-FH4 in the cell.  The enzyme uses methionine and glycine to sense the pools of C1-FH4 and FH4, respectively. This domain belongs to the formyltransferase (FMT) domain superfamily. Members of this family have an N-terminal ACT domain, which is  commonly involved in specifically bind an amino acid or other small ligand leading to regulation of the enzyme. The N-terminal of this protein family may be responsible for the binding of the regulators methionine and glycine.</td>

Met-tRNA-FMT transfers a formyl group from N-10 formyltetrahydrofolate to the amino terminal end of a methionyl-aminoacyl-tRNA acyl moiety, yielding formyl-Met-tRNA. Formyl-Met-tRNA plays essential role in protein translation initiation by forming complex with IF2. The formyl group plays a dual role in the initiator identity of N-formylmethionyl-tRNA by promoting its recognition by IF2 and by impairing its binding to EFTU-GTP.  The N-terminal domain contains a Rossmann fold and it is the catalytic domain of the enzyme.</td>

The C-terminal dehydrogenase domain of ArnA catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) to UDP-4-keto-arabinose (UDP-Ara4O), while the N-terminal formyltransferase domain of ArnA catalyzes the addition of a formyl group to UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (UDP-L-Ara4N) to form UDP-L-4-formamido-arabinose (UDP-L-Ara4FN). This domain family represents the catalytic core of the N-terminal formyltransferase domain. The formyltransferase also contains a smaller C-terminal domain the may be  involved in substrate binding. ArnA forms a hexameric structure, in which the dehydrogenase domains are arranged at the center of the particle with the transformylase domains on the outside of the particle.</td>

In Streptomyces albus a member of this family has been shown to be involved in the synthesis of oxazolomycin (OZM). OZM is a hybrid peptide-polyketide antibiotic and exhibits potent antitumor and antiviral activities. It is a multi-domain protein consisting of a formyl transferase domain, a Flavin-utilizing monoxygenase domain, a LuxE domain functioning as an acyl protein synthetase and a pp-binding domain, which may function as an acyl carrier. It shows sequence similarity with other peptide-polyketide biosynthesis proteins.</td>
