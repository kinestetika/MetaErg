            <td id=al>heat shock survival AAA family ATPase ClpK. ClpK, a Clp family AAA ATPase, was discovered as a plasmid-encoded determinant for survival of heat shock along with other putative heat shock proteins. ClpK requires the presence of ClpP to confer heat resistance. ClpK is about  65% identical to ClpG. Note that PMID:26974352 and PMID:29263094 discuss both ClpG itself and a member of this family (ClpK) that they call ClpG-GI.</td>

Bacterial Caseinolytic peptidase B (ClpB) and eukaryotic Heat shock protein 104 (Hsp104) are ATP-dependent molecular chaperones and essential proteins of the heat-shock response. ClpB/Hsp104 ATPases, in concert with the DnaK/Hsp70 chaperone system, disaggregate and reactivate aggregated proteins. This RecA-like_ClpB_Hsp104_like subfamily belongs to the RecA-like NTPase family which includes the NTP binding domain of F1 and V1 H(+)ATPases, DnaB and related helicases as well as bacterial RecA and related eukaryotic and archaeal recombinases. The RecA-like NTPase family also includes bacterial conjugation proteins and related DNA transfer proteins involved in type II and type IV secretion.</td>

Members of the AAA+ ATPases function as molecular chaperons, ATPase subunits of proteases, helicases, or nucleic-acid stimulated ATPases.

Compared with the D1-small domain (included in AAA) it lacks the long coiled-coil insertion, and instead of helix C4 contains a beta-strand (e3) that is part of a three stranded beta-pleated sheet. In Thermophilus the whole protein forms a hexamer with the D1-small and D2-small domains located on the outside of the hexamer, with the long coiled-coil being exposed on the surface. The D2-small domain is essential for oligomerisation, forming a tight interface with the D2-large domain of a neighbouring subunit and thereby providing enough binding energy to stabilise the functional assembly. The domain is associated with two Clp_N at the N-terminus as well as AAA and AAA_2.</td>
