CPR, also called 2-dehydropantolactone reductase, or 2-dehydropantolactone reductase (A-specific), or ketopantoyl-lactone reductase, acts as a NADPH-dependent conjugated polyketone reductase with broad substrate specificity and strict stereospecificity. It reduces ketopantoyl lactone and isatin.</td>
