It is present in a variety of proteins including those involved in chaperone, cell-cycle, transcription, and protein transport complexes. The number of TPR motifs varies among proteins. Those containing 5-6 tandem repeats generate a right-handed helical structure with an amphipathic channel that is thought to accommodate an alpha-helix of a target protein. It has been proposed that TPR proteins preferentially interact with WD-40 repeat proteins, but in many instances several TPR-proteins seem to aggregate to multi-protein complexes.</td>

Social motility in delta-proteobacterial species such as Myxococcus xanthus depends on a type VI pilus, which in turn depends on assembly of the PilQ secretin complex. Tgl, a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) outer membrane lipoprotein, is required for PilQ assembly.</td>

In addition to its function as an O-GlcNAc transferase, human OGT also appears to proteolytically cleave the epigenetic cell-cycle regulator HCF-1.</td>

This family, more specifically, includes PA2778 as found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All members of the defining seed alignment are encoded in the vicinity of a homolog of PA2779 (see HMM NF033919). Note that the C-terminal region consists largely of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), so classification using this HMM must be based on comparing the top domain score to the second gathering threshold (GA2).</td>
