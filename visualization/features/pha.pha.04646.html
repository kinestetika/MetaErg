These domains are found in the GluR0 proteins that have been shown to function as prokaryotic L-glutamate activated potassium channels, also known ionotropic glutamate receptors or iGluRs. In addition to two ligand binding core domains, iGluRs typically have a channel-like domain inserted in the middle of the GluR-like domain.  The GluR0 proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge.

            <td id=al>cd00998 The ligand-binding domain of ionotropic glutamate receptor family, a member of the periplasmic binding protein type II superfamily. This subfamily represents the ligand binding of ionotropic glutamate receptors. iGluRs are heterotetrameric ion channels that comprises of three functionally distinct subtypes based on their pharmacology and structural similarities:  AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), and kainate receptors.  All three types of channels are also activated by the physiological neurotransmitter, glutamate. iGluRs are concentrated at postsynaptic sites, where they exert a variety of different functions.  While this ligand-binding domain of iGluRs is structurally homologous to the periplasmic binding fold type II superfamily, the N-terminal leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP)-like domain belongs to the periplasmic-binding fold type I.</td>

This domain is found in solute binding proteins that serve as initial receptors in the ABC transport, signal transduction and channel gating.  The PBP2 proteins share the same architecture as periplasmic binding proteins type 1, but have a different topology. They are typically comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.  The majority of PBP2 proteins function in the uptake of small soluble substrates in eubacteria and archaea.  After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically-located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the family includes ionotropic glutamate receptors and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd13704 The periplasmic sensor domain of histidine kinase receptors; the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein. This subfamily includes the periplasmic sensor domain of the histidine kinase receptors (HisK) which are elements of the two-component signal transduction systems commonly found in bacteria and lower eukaryotes. Typically, the two-component system consists of a membrane-spanning histidine kinase sensor and a cytoplasmic response regulator. The two-component systems serve as a stimulus-response coupling mechanism to enable microorganisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. Extracellular stimuli such as small molecule ligands and ions are detected by the N-terminal periplasmic sensing domain of the sensor kinase receptor, which regulate the catalytic activity of the cytoplasmic kinase domain and promote ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue. The phosphate is then transferred to a conserved aspartate in the response regulator through a phospho-transfer mechanism, and the activity of the response regulator is in turn regulated. The sensor domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold protein (PBP2) superfamily, whose members are involved in chemotaxis and uptake of nutrients and other small molecules from the extracellular space through their function as an initial high-affinity binding component. PBP2 typically comprises of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>

The ligand-binding domain of the ionotropic NMDA subtype is structurally homologous to the periplasmic-binding fold type II superfamily, while the N-terminal domain belongs to the periplasmic-binding fold type I.  The function of the NMDA subtype receptor serves critical functions in neuronal development, functioning, and degeneration in the mammalian central nervous system. The functional NMDA receptor is a heterotetramer comprising two NR1 and two NR2 (A, B, C, and D) or NR3 (A and B) subunits. The receptor controls a cation channel that is highly permeable to monovalent ions and calcium and exhibits voltage-dependent inhibition by magnesium. Dual agonists, glutamate and glycine, are required for efficient activation of the NMDA receptor. Among NMDA receptor subtypes, the NR2B subunit containing receptors appear particularly important for pain perception; thus NR2B-selective antagonists may be useful in the treatment of chronic pain.</td>

Cystine-binding domain of periplasmic receptor-dependent ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.  Cystine is an oxidized dimeric form of cysteine that is required for optimal bacterial growth. In Bacillus subtilis, three ABC transporters, TcyJKLMN (YtmJKLMN), TcyABC (YckKJI), and YxeMNO are involved in uptake of cystine. Also, three uptake systems were identified in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, while in Escherichia coli, two transport systems seem to be involved in cystine uptake. Moreover, L-cystine limitation was shown to prevent virulence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae; thus, its L-cystine solute receptor (Ngo0372) may be suited as target for an antimicrobial vaccine. The cystine receptor belongs to the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily (PBP2).

This group contains the second domain of the periplasmic solute-binding domains of BvgS and related proteins. BvgS is composed of two periplasmic domains homologous to bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins (PBPs), a transmembrane region followed successively by a cytoplasmic PAS (Per/ARNT/SIM), a Histidine-kinase (HK), a receiver and a Histidine phosphotransfer (Hpt) domains. The sensor protein BvgS can autophosphorylate and phosphorylate the response regulator BvgA. The BvgAS phosphorelay controls the expression of virulence factors in response to certain environmental stimuli in Bordetella pertussis.

While this ligand-binding domain is structurally homologous to the periplasmic-binding fold type II superfamily, the N-terminal domain of delta receptors belongs to the periplasmic-binding fold type I. Although the delta receptors are a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, they cannot be activated by AMPA, kainate, NMDA, glutamate, or any other ligands. Phylogenetical analysis shows that both GluRdelta1 and GluRdelta2 are more homologous to non-NMDA receptors. GluRdelta2 was shown to function as an AMPA-like receptor by mutation analysis. Moreover, targeted disruption of GluRdelta2 gene caused motor coordination impairment, Purkinje cell maturation, and long-term depression of synaptic transmission. It has been suggested that GluRdelta2 is the receptor for cerebellin 1, a glycoprotein of the Clq, and the tumor necrosis factor family which is secreted from cerebellar granule cells. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the orphan GluRdelta1 plays an essential role in high-frequency hearing and ionic homeostasis in the basal cochlea and that the locus encoding GluRdelta1 may be involved in congenial or acquired high-frequency hearing loss in humans.</td>

This group includes periplasmic sensor domain of the histidine kinase receptors (HisK) which are elements of the two-component signal transduction systems commonly found in bacteria and lower eukaryotes. Typically, the two-component system consists of a membrane-spanning histidine kinase sensor and a cytoplasmic response regulator. The two-component systems serve as a stimulus-response coupling mechanism to enable microorganisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. Extracellular stimuli such as small molecule ligands and ions are detected by the N-terminal periplasmic sensing domain of the sensor kinase receptor, which regulate the catalytic activity of the cytoplasmic kinase domain and promote ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue. The phosphate is then transferred to a conserved aspartate in the response regulator through a phospho-transfer mechanism, and the activity of the response regulator is in turn regulated. The sensor domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold protein (PBP2) superfamily, whose members are involved in chemotaxis and uptake of nutrients and other small molecules from the extracellular space through their function as an initial high-affinity binding component.

This group contains the ligand binding domain of the NR1, an essential channel-forming subunit of the NMDA receptor. The ionotropic N-methyl-d-asparate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors serves critical functions in neuronal development, functioning, and degeneration in the mammalian central nervous system. The functional NMDA receptor is a heterotetramer ccomposed of two NR1 and two NR2 (A, B, C, and D) or of NR3 (A and B) subunits. The receptor controls a cation channel that is highly permeable to monovalent ions and calcium and exhibits voltage-dependent inhibition by magnesium. Dual agonists, glutamate and glycine, are required for efficient activation of the NMDA receptor. When co-expressed with NR1, the NR3 subunits form receptors that are activated by glycine alone and therefore can be classified as excitatory glycine receptors. NR1/NR3 receptors are calcium-impermeable and unaffected by ligands acting at the NR2 glutamate-binding site.</td>
