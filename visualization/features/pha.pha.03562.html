            <td id=al>cd07709 catalytic domain of flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) and related proteins; MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase domain. FDPs catalyze the reduction of oxygen and/or nitric oxide to water or nitrous oxide respectively. In addition to this N-terminal catalytic domain they contain a C-terminal flavin mononucleotide-binding flavodoxin-like domain. Although some FDPs are able to reduce NO or O2 with similar catalytic efficiencies others are selective for either NO or O2, such as Escherichia coli flavorubredoxin which is selective toward NO and G. intestinalis FDP which is selective toward O2. These enzymes belong to the MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase superfamily which is comprised mainly of hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions. Some members of this subgroup are single domain.</td>

This entry represents the FMN-binding domain found in NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductases (flavin reductases), a class of enzymes capable of producing reduced flavin for bacterial bioluminescence and other biological processes. This domain is also found in various other oxidoreductase and monooxygenase enzymes... This domain consists of a beta-barrel with Greek key topology, and is related to the ferredoxin reductase-like FAD-binding domain. The flavin reductases have a different dimerisation mode than that found in the PNP oxidase-like family, which also carries an FMN-binding domain with a similar topology.</td>

This is a flavin reductase family consisting of enzymes known to be flavin reductases as well as various oxidoreductase and monooxygenase components. VlmR is a flavin reductase that functions in a two-component enzyme system to provide isobutylamine N-hydroxylase with reduced flavin and may be involved in the synthesis of valanimycin. SnaC is a flavin reductase that provides reduced flavin for the oxidation of pristinamycin IIB to pristinamycin IIA as catalyzed by SnaA, SnaB heterodimer. This flavin reductase region characterized by enzymes of the family is present in the C-terminus of potential FMN proteins from Synechocystis sp. suggesting it is a flavin reductase domain.</td>

Except for the competence protein these proteins bind two zinc ions per molecule as cofactor.</td>

The class B metal beta-lactamases (MBLs) from which this fold was named are only a small fraction of the activities which are included in this superfamily. Activities carried out by superfamily members include class B beta-lactamases, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases, AHL (acyl homoserine lactone) lactonases, persulfide dioxygenases, flavodiiron proteins, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors such as the Int9 and Int11 subunits of Integrator, Sdsa1-like and AtsA-like arylsulfatases, 5'-exonucleases human SNM1A and yeast Pso2p, ribonuclease J and ribonuclease Z, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, insecticide hydrolases, and proteins required for natural transformation competence. Classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, however the diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry.</td>

Members of the MBL-fold metallohydrolase superfamily are mainly hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions. The class B metal beta-lactamases (MBLs) for which this fold was named perform only a small fraction of the activities included in this superfamily. Activities carried out by superfamily members include class B beta-lactamases which can catalyze the hydrolysis of a wide range of beta-lactam antibiotics, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases (also called glyoxalase II) which hydrolyze S-d-lactoylglutathione to d-lactate in the second step of the glycoxlase system, AHL lactonases which catalyze the hydrolysis and opening of the homoserine lactone rings of acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), persulfide dioxygenase which catalyze the oxidation of glutathione persulfide to glutathione and persulfite in the mitochondria, flavodiiron proteins which catalyze the reduction of oxygen and/or nitric oxide to water or nitrous oxide respectively, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors such as the Int9 and Int11 subunits of Integrator, Sdsa1-like and AtsA-like arylsulfatases, 5'-exonucleases human SNM1A and yeast Pso2p, ribonuclease J which has both 5'-3' exoribonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activity and ribonuclease Z which catalyzes the endonucleolytic removal of the 3' extension of the majority of tRNA precursors, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases which decompose cyclic adenosine and guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP and cGMP) respectively, insecticide hydrolases, and proteins required for natural transformation competence. The diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry, for example classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, human persulfide dioxygenase ETHE1 is a mono-iron binding member of the superfamily; Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases incorporates iron, manganese, and zinc in its dinuclear metal binding site, and flavodiiron proteins contains a diiron site.</td>
