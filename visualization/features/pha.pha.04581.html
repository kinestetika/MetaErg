            <td id=al>Rieske domain; a [2Fe-2S] cluster binding domain commonly found in Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase (RO) systems such as naphthalene and biphenyl dioxygenases, as well as in plant/cyanobacterial chloroplast b6f and mitochondrial cytochrome bc(1) complexes. The Rieske domain can be divided into two subdomains, with an incomplete six-stranded, antiparallel beta-barrel at one end, and an iron-sulfur cluster binding subdomain at the other. The Rieske iron-sulfur center contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is involved in electron transfer, and is liganded to two histidine and two cysteine residues present in conserved sequences called Rieske motifs. In RO systems, the N-terminal Rieske domain of the alpha subunit acts as an electron shuttle that accepts electrons from a reductase or ferredoxin component and transfers them to the mononuclear iron in the alpha subunit C-terminal domain to be used for catalysis.</td>

            <td id=al>Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase (RO) family, Rieske ferredoxin component; composed of the Rieske ferredoxin component of some three-component RO systems including biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO) and carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase (CARDO). The RO family comprise a large class of aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases found predominantly in microorganisms. These enzymes enable microorganisms to tolerate and even exclusively utilize aromatic compounds for growth. ROs consist of two or three components: reductase, oxygenase, and ferredoxin (in some cases) components. The ferredoxin component contains either a plant-type or Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster. The Rieske ferredoxin component in this family carries an electron from the RO reductase component to the terminal RO oxygenase component. BPDO degrades biphenyls and polychlorinated biphenyls. BPDO ferredoxin (BphF) has structural features consistent with a minimal and perhaps archetypical Rieske protein in that the insertions that give other Rieske proteins unique structural features are missing. CARDO catalyzes dihydroxylation at the C1 and C9a positions of carbazole. Rieske ferredoxins are found as subunits of membrane oxidase complexes, cis-dihydrodiol-forming aromatic dioxygenases, bacterial assimilatory nitrite reductases, and arsenite oxidase. Rieske ferredoxins are also found as soluble electron carriers in bacterial dioxygenase and monooxygenase complexes.</td>

The Rieske domain is a [2Fe-2S] cluster binding domain involved in electron transfer. AIFL shares 35% homology with human AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor), mainly in the Pyr_redox domain. AIFL is predominantly localized to the mitochondria. AIFL induces apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner.</td>

Two conserved cysteines coordinate one Fe ion, while the other Fe ion is coordinated by two conserved histidines. In hyperthermophilic archaea there is a SKTPCX(2-3)C motif at the C-terminus. The cysteines in this motif form a disulphide bridge, which stabilizes the protein.</td>

            <td id=al>Assimilatory nitrite reductase (NirD) family, Rieske domain; Assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases convert nitrate through nitrite to ammonium.

The fungal NirD is involved in nutrient acquisition, functioning at the soil/fungus interface to control nutrient exchange between the fungus and the host plant. The Rieske domain is a [2Fe-2S] cluster binding domain involved in electron transfer. The Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster is liganded to two histidine and two cysteine residues present in conserved sequences called Rieske motifs. In this family, only a few members contain these residues. Other members may have lost the ability to bind the Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster.</td>

These enzymes enable microorganisms to tolerate and even exclusively utilize aromatic compounds for growth. ROs consist of two or three components: reductase, oxygenase, and ferredoxin (in some cases) components.

The oxygenase alpha subunit has two domains, an N-terminal Rieske domain with an [2Fe-2S] cluster and a C-terminal catalytic domain with a mononuclear Fe(II) binding site. The Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster accepts electrons from the reductase or ferredoxin component and transfers them to the mononuclear iron for catalysis. Reduced pyridine nucleotide is used as the initial source of two electrons for dioxygen activation.</td>

The oxygenase alpha subunit contains an N-terminal Rieske domain with an [2Fe-2S] cluster and a C-terminal catalytic domain with a mononuclear Fe(II) binding site. The Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster accepts electrons from a reductase or ferredoxin component and transfers them to the mononuclear iron for catalysis. Vanillate-O-demethylase is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of a terminal oxygenase (VanA) and reductase (VanB) components. This enzyme reductively catalyzes the conversion of vanillate into protocatechuate and formaldehyde. Protocatechuate and vanillate are important intermediate metabolites in the degradation pathway of lignin-derived compounds such as ferulic acid and vanillin by soil microbes.  DDmC is the oxygenase component of a three-component dicamba O-demethylase found in Pseudomonas maltophila, that catalyzes the conversion of a widely used herbicide called herbicide dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) to DCSA (3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid).</td>
