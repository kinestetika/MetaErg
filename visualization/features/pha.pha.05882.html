            <td id=al>acetolactate synthase, large subunit, biosynthetic type. Two groups of proteins form acetolactate from two molecules of pyruvate. The type of acetolactate synthase described in this model also catalyzes the formation of acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate, an early step in the branched chain amino acid biosynthesis; it is therefore also termed acetohydroxyacid synthase. In bacteria, this catalytic chain is associated with a smaller regulatory chain in an alpha2/beta2 heterotetramer. Acetolactate synthase is a thiamine pyrophosphate enzyme. In this type, FAD and Mg++ are also found. Several isozymes of this enzyme are found in E. coli K12, one of which contains a frameshift in the large subunit gene and is not expressed.

            <td id=al>acetolactate synthase, catabolic. Acetolactate synthase (EC 2.2.1.6) combines two molecules of pyruvate to yield 2-acetolactate with the release of CO2. This reaction may be involved in either valine biosynthesis (biosynthetic) or conversion of pyruvate to acetoin and possibly to 2,3-butanediol (catabolic). The biosynthetic type, described by TIGR00118, is also capable of forming acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis. The family described here, part of the same larger family of thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzymes (pfam00205, pfam02776) is the catabolic form, generally found associated with in species with acetolactate decarboxylase and usually found in the same operon. The model may not encompass all catabolic acetolactate synthases, but rather one particular clade in the larger TPP-dependent enzyme family. [Energy metabolism, Fermentation]</td>

It should not be confused with pyruvate dehydrogenase [cytochrome] (EC 1.2.2.2) as in E. coli PoxB, although the E. coli enzyme is closely homologous and has pyruvate oxidase as an alternate name.

            <td id=al>Pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain of POX and related proteins. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP family), pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain of pyruvate oxidase (POX) and related protiens subfamily. The PYR domain is found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. For glyoxylate carboligase, which belongs to this subfamily, but lacks this conserved glutamate, the rate of the initial TPP activation step is reduced but the ensuing steps of the enzymic reaction proceed efficiently. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites, for many the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. POX decarboxylates pyruvate, producing hydrogen peroxide and the energy-storage metabolite acetylphosphate. This subfamily includes pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and indolepyruvate decarboxylase (IPDC). PDC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and CO2 in alcoholic fermentation. IPDC plays a role in the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway in plants and various plant-associated bacteria, it catalyzes the decarboxylation of IPA to IAA. This subfamily also includes the large catalytic subunit of acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS). AHAS catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of pyruvate to give the acetohydroxyacid, 2-acetolactate, a precursor of the branched chain amino acids, valine and leucine. AHAS also catalyzes the condensation of pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate to form 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate in isoleucine biosynthesis. Methanococcus jannaschii sulfopyruvate decarboxylase (MjComDE) and phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase (PpyrDc) also belong to this subfamily. PpyrDc is a homotrimeric enzyme having the PP and PYR domains tandemly arranged on the same subunit. It functions in the biosynthesis of C-P compounds such as bialaphos tripeptide in Streptomyces hygroscopicus. MjComDE is a dodecamer having the PYR and PP domains on different subunits, it has six alpha (PYR/ComD) subunits and six beta (PP/ComE) subunits. MjComDE catalyzes the decarboxylation of sulfopyruvic acid to sulfoacetaldehyde in the coenzyme M pathway.</td>
