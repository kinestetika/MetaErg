            <td id=al>cd05325 carbonyl reductase sniffer-like, classical (c) SDRs. Sniffer is an NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase of the classical SDR family. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster implicate Sniffer in the prevention of neurodegeneration due to aging and oxidative-stress. This subgroup also includes Rhodococcus sp. AD45 IsoH, which is an NAD-dependent 1-hydroxy-2-glutathionyl-2-methyl-3-butene dehydrogenase involved in isoprene metabolism, Aspergillus nidulans StcE encoded by a gene which is part of a proposed sterigmatocystin biosynthesis gene cluster, Bacillus circulans SANK 72073 BtrF encoded by a gene found in the butirosin biosynthesis gene cluster, and Aspergillus parasiticus nor-1 involved in the biosynthesis of aflatoxins. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05327 retinol dehydrogenase (retinol-DH), Light dependent Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) OxidoReductase (LPOR) and related proteins, classical (c) SDRs. Classical SDR subgroup containing retinol-DHs, LPORs, and related proteins. Retinol is processed by a medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase followed by retinol-DHs. Pchlide reductases act in chlorophyll biosynthesis. There are distinct enzymes that catalyze Pchlide reduction in light or dark conditions. Light-dependent reduction is via an NADP-dependent SDR, LPOR. Proteins in this subfamily share the glycine-rich NAD-binding motif of the classical SDRs, have a partial match to the canonical active site tetrad, but lack the typical active site Ser. This subgroup includes the human proteins: retinol dehydrogenase -12, -13 ,and -14, dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member (DHRS)-12 , -13 and -X (a DHRS on chromosome X), and WWOX (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase), as well as a Neurospora crassa SDR encoded by the blue light inducible bli-4 gene.

PTCR is a classical SDR which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ketones on steroids and prostaglandins. Unlike most SDRs, PTCR functions as a monomer. This subgroup also includes human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and CBR3. CBR1 is an NADPH-dependent SDR with broad substrate specificity and may be responsible for the in vivo reduction of quinones, prostaglandins, and other carbonyl-containing compounds. In addition it includes poppy NADPH-dependent salutaridine reductase which catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of salutaridine to 7(S)-salutaridinol in the biosynthesis of morphine, and Arabidopsis SDR1,a menthone reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of menthone to neomenthol, a compound with antimicrobial activity; SDR1  can also carry out neomenthol oxidation.

This subgroup includes Escherichai coli EntA which catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate during biosynthesis of the siderophore Enterobactin. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05274 ketoreductase (KR) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), complex (x) SDRs. Ketoreductase, a module of the multidomain polyketide synthase (PKS), has 2 subdomains, each corresponding  to a SDR family monomer. The C-terminal subdomain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the beta-carbonyl of a polyketide to a hydroxyl group, a step in the biosynthesis of polyketides, such as erythromycin. The N-terminal subdomain, an interdomain linker, is a truncated Rossmann fold which acts to stabilizes the catalytic subdomain. Unlike typical SDRs, the isolated domain does not oligomerize but is composed of 2 subdomains, each resembling an SDR monomer. The active site resembles that of typical SDRs, except that the usual positions of the catalytic Asn and Tyr are swapped, so that the canonical YXXXK motif changes to YXXXN. Modular PKSs are multifunctional structures in which the makeup recapitulates that found in (and may have evolved from) FAS.  In some instances, such as porcine FAS, an enoyl reductase (ER) module is inserted between the sub-domains. Fatty acid synthesis occurs via the stepwise elongation of a chain (which is attached to acyl carrier protein, ACP) with 2-carbon units. Eukaryotic systems consist of large, multifunctional synthases (type I) while bacterial, type II systems, use single function proteins. Fungal fatty acid synthase uses a dodecamer of 6 alpha and 6 beta subunits. In mammalian type FAS cycles, ketoacyl synthase forms acetoacetyl-ACP which is reduced by the NADP-dependent beta-KR, forming beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP, which is in turn dehydrated by dehydratase to a beta-enoyl intermediate, which is reduced by NADP-dependent beta-ER. Polyketide synthesis also proceeds via the addition of 2-carbon units as in fatty acid synthesis. The complex SDR NADP-binding motif, GGXGXXG, is often present, but is not strictly conserved in each instance of the module. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues.

SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix motif that is not generally found among SDRs.</td>

This subgroup contains insect type ADH, and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) type I; these proteins are classical SDRs. ADH catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes/ketones. This subgroup is distinct from the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, and evolved in fruit flies to allow the digestion of fermenting fruit. 15-PGDH catalyzes the NAD-dependent interconversion of (5Z,13E)-(15S)-11alpha,15-dihydroxy-9-oxoprost-13-enoate and (5Z,13E)-11alpha-hydroxy-9,15-dioxoprost-13-enoate, and has a typical SDR glycine-rich NAD-binding motif, which is not fully present in ADH.  SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

BKR, a member of the SDR family, catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of acyl carrier protein in the first reductive step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS).

            <td id=al>TIGR01500 sepiapterin reductase. This model describes sepiapterin reductase, a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The enzyme catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin. A similar enzyme in Bacillus cereus was isolated for its ability to convert benzil to (S)-benzoin, a property sepiapterin reductase also shares. Cutoff scores for this model are set such that benzil reductase scores between trusted and noise cutoffs.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08953 ketoreductase (KR), subgroup 2, complex (x) SDRs. Ketoreductase, a module of the multidomain polyketide synthase (PKS), has 2 subdomains, each corresponding  to a SDR family monomer. The C-terminal subdomain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the beta-carbonyl of a polyketide to a hydroxyl group, a step in the biosynthesis of polyketides, such as erythromycin. The N-terminal subdomain, an interdomain linker, is a truncated Rossmann fold which acts to stabilizes the catalytic subdomain. Unlike typical SDRs, the isolated domain does not oligomerize but is composed of 2 subdomains, each resembling an SDR monomer. The active site resembles that of typical SDRs, except that the usual positions of the catalytic Asn and Tyr are swapped, so that the canonical YXXXK motif changes to YXXXN. Modular PKSs are multifunctional structures in which the makeup recapitulates that found in (and may have evolved from) FAS. Polyketide synthesis also proceeds via the addition of 2-carbon units as in fatty acid synthesis. The complex SDR NADP-binding motif, GGXGXXG, is often present, but is not strictly conserved in each instance of the module. This subfamily includes both KR domains of the Bacillus subtilis Pks J,-L, and PksM, and all three KR domains of PksN, components of the megacomplex bacillaene synthase, which synthesizes the antibiotic bacillaene. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05337 putative beta-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein [ACP] reductase (BKR), subgroup 1, classical (c) SDR. This subgroup includes Escherichia coli CFT073 FabG. The Escherichai coli K12 BKR, FabG, belongs to a different subgroup. BKR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ACP in the first reductive step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS). FAS consists of four elongation steps, which are repeated to extend the fatty acid chain through the addition of two-carbo units from malonyl acyl-carrier protein (ACP): condensation, reduction, dehydration, and a final reduction. Type II FAS, typical of plants and many bacteria, maintains these activities on discrete polypeptides, while type I FAS utilizes one or two multifunctional polypeptides. BKR resembles enoyl reductase, which catalyzes the second reduction step in FAS. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) NAD(P)(H) binding region and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues.   Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns.  These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H) binding pattern: TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif.  Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P) binding motif and  an altered active site motif (YXXXN).  Fungal type type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.  Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P) binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues.  Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site.  Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr-151 and Lys-155, and well as Asn-111 (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix motif that is not generally found among SDRs.</td>
