            <td id=al>DNA-binding effector domain of two-component system response regulators. Bacteria and some eukaryotes use two-component signal transduction systems to detect and respond to changes in the environment. The systems consists of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. The former autophosphorylates a histidine residue on detecting an external stimulus. The phosphate is then transferred to an invariant aspartate residue in a highly conserved receiver domain of the response regulator. Phosphorylation activates a variable effector domain of the response regulator, which triggers the cellular response. This C-terminal effector domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcriptional regulators and contains DNA and RNA polymerase binding sites. Several dimers or monomers bind head to tail to small tandem repeats upstream of the genes. The RNA polymerase binding sites interact with the alpha or sigma subunit of RNA polymerase.</td>

Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

Cytokinin signaling involves a phosphorelay cascade by histidine kinase receptors (AHKs), histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) and downstream ARRs. ARRs are divided into two groups, type-A and -B, according to their sequence and domain structure. Type-B ARRs contain a receiver (REC) domain and a large C-terminal extension that has characteristics of an effector or output domain, with a Myb-like DNA binding domain referred to as the GARP domain.

            <td id=al>pseudo receiver domain of pseudo-response regulators. In Arabidopsis, five pseudo-response regulators (PRRs), also called APRRs, comprise a core group of clock components that controls the pace of the central oscillator of the circadian clock, an endogenous time-keeping mechanism that enables organisms to adapt to external daily cycles. The coordinated sequential expression of PRR9 (APRR9), PRR7 (APRR7), PRR5 (APRR5), PRR3 (APRR3), and PRR1 (APRR1) results in circadian waves that may be at the basis of the endogenous circadian clock. PRRs contain an N-terminal pseudo receiver (psREC) domain that resembles the receiver domain of a two-component response regulator, but lacks an aspartate residue that accepts a phosphoryl group from the sensor kinase, and a CCT motif at the C-terminus that contains a putative nuclear localization signal. The psREC domain is involved in protein-protein interactions.</td>

Pseudomonas aeruginosa PilR is the response regulator of the PilS/PilR two-component regulatory system (PilSR TCS) that acts in conjunction with sigma-54 to regulate the expression of type 4 pilus (T4P) major subunit PilA. In addition, the PilSR TCS regulates flagellum-dependent swimming motility and pilus-dependent twitching motility. PilR contains an N-terminal REC domain, a central sigma-54 interaction domain, and a C-terminal Fis-type helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hydrogen uptake protein regulator (HupR). Members of this subfamily are response regulator components of two-component systems that regulates hydrogenase activity, including HupR and HoxA. HupR is part of the HupT/HupR system that controls the synthesis of the membrane-bound [NiFe]hydrogenase, HupSL, of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. It belongs to the nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) family of response regulators, which activate transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) in response to a change in the environment.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of Brucella abortus CpdR and CckA, and similar domains. Two-component systems (TCSs), consisting of a sensor and a response regulator, are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by TCSs in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis and membrane transport. Response regulators share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and differ output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand, and protein-binding, or enzymatic domain. CpdR is a stand-alone REC protein. CckA is a sensor histidine kinase containing N-terminal PAS domains and a C-terminal REC domain. CpdR and CckA are components of a regulatory phosphorelay system (composed of CckA, ChpT, CtrA and CpdR) that controls Brucella abortus cell growth, division, and intracellular survival inside mammalian host cells. CckA autophosphorylates in the presence of ATP and transfers a phosphoryl group to the conserved aspartic acid residue on its C-terminal REC domain, which is relayed to the ChpT phosphotransferase. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of chemotaxis response regulator protein-glutamate methylesterase CheB and similar chemotaxis proteins. Methylesterase CheB is a chemotaxis response regulator with an N-terminal REC domain and a C-terminal methylesterase domain. Chemotaxis is a behavior known in motile bacteria that directs their movement in response to chemical gradients. CheB is a phosphorylation-activated response regulator involved in the reversible modification of bacterial chemotaxis receptors. It catalyzes the demethylation of specific methylglutamate residues introduced into the chemoreceptors (methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) by CheR. The CheB REC domain packs against the active site of the C-terminal domain and inhibits methylesterase activity by directly restricting access to the active site. Also included in this family is chemotaxis response regulator CheY, which contains a stand-alone REC domain, and an uncharacterized subfamily composed of proteins containing an N-terminal REC domain and a C-terminal CheY-P phosphatase (CheC) domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
