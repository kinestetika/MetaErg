This group is composed of uncharacterized bacterial MFS-type transporters including Bacillus subtilis YcxA and YbfB. YcxA has been shown to facilitate the export of surfactin in B. subtilis. The YcxA-like group belongs to the Monocarboxylate transporter -like (MCT-like) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins. MFS proteins are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>Oxalate:formate antiporter (OFA) and similar proteins of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. This subfamily is composed of Oxalobacter formigenes oxalate:formate antiporter (OFA or OxlT) and similar proteins. O. formigenes, a commensal found in the gut of animals and humans, plays an important role in clearing dietary oxalate from the intestinal tract, which is carried out by OFA/OxlT, an anion transporter that facilitates the exchange of divalent oxalate with monovalent formate, the product of oxalate decarboxylation. This exchange generates an electrochemical proton gradient and is the source of energy for ATP synthesis in this cell. The OFA-like subfamily belongs to the Monocarboxylate transporter -like (MCT-like) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins. MFS proteins are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. The animal Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family is also called Solute carrier family 16 (SLC16 or SLC16A). It is composed of 14 members, MCT1-14. MCTs play an integral role in cellular metabolism via lactate transport and have been implicated in metabolic synergy in tumors. MCT1-4 are proton-coupled transporters that facilitate the transport across the plasma membrane of monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, branched-chain oxo acids derived from leucine, valine and isoleucine, and ketone bodies such as acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetate. MCT8 and MCT10 are transporters which stimulate the cellular uptake of thyroid hormones such as thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and diidothyronine (T2). MCT10 also functions as a sodium-independent transporter that mediates the uptake or efflux of aromatic acids. Many members are orphan transporters whose substrates are yet to be determined. The MCT family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family and similar transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily. The group is composed of the Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family in animals and similar transporters from fungi, plants, archaea, and bacteria. MCT is also called Solute carrier family 16 (SLC16 or SLC16A). It is composed of 14 members, MCT1-14. MCTs play an integral role in cellular metabolism via lactate transport and have been implicated in metabolic synergy in tumors. MCTs have been found to facilitate the transport across the plasma membrane not only of monocarboxylates (MCT1-4), but also thyroid hormones (MCT8/10), and aromatic acids (MCT10). Yeast MCT homologous (Mch) proteins are not involved in the uptake of monocarboxylates; their substrates are not known. The MCT-like family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>bacterial MdtG-like and eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. This family is composed of eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family transporters and related bacterial multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters including several proteins from Escherichia coli such as multidrug resistance protein MdtG, from Bacillus subtilis such as multidrug resistance proteins 1 (Bmr1) and 2 (Bmr2), and from Staphylococcus aureus such as quinolone resistance protein NorA. The family also includes Escherichia coli arabinose efflux transporters YfcJ and YhhS. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. The SLC18 transporter family includes vesicular monoamine transporters (VAT1 and VAT2), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and SLC18B1, which is proposed to be a vesicular polyamine transporter (VPAT). The MdtG/SLC18 family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

YfmO acts to efflux copper or a copper complex, and could contribute to copper resistance. YmfD/YmfE is involved in secretion of bacillibactin.

            <td id=al>Major Facilitator Superfamily. The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) is a large and diverse group of secondary transporters that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. MFS proteins facilitate the transport across cytoplasmic or internal membranes of a variety of substrates including ions, sugar phosphates, drugs, neurotransmitters, nucleosides, amino acids, and peptides. They do so using the electrochemical potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins have medical significance in humans such as the glucose transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen storage disease when mutated.</td>
