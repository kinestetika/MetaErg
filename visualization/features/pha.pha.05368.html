            <td id=al>ATP-binding cassette domain of MutS2. MutS2 homologs in bacteria and eukaryotes. The MutS protein initiates DNA mismatch repair by recognizing mispaired and unpaired bases embedded in duplex DNA and activating endo- and exonucleases to remove the mismatch. Members of the MutS family also possess a conserved ATPase activity that belongs to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. MutS homologs (MSH) have been identified in most prokaryotic and all eukaryotic organisms examined. Prokaryotes have two homologs (MutS1 and MutS2), whereas seven MSH proteins (MSH1 to MSH7) have been identified in eukaryotes. The homodimer MutS1 and heterodimers MSH2-MSH3 and MSH2-MSH6 are primarily involved in mitotic mismatch repair, whereas MSH4-MSH5 is involved in resolution of Holliday junctions during meiosis. All members of the MutS family contain the highly conserved Walker A/B ATPase domain, and many share a common mechanism of action. MutS1, MSH2-MSH3, MSH2-MSH6, and MSH4-MSH5 dimerize to form sliding clamps, and recognition of specific DNA structures or lesions results in ADP/ATP exchange.</td>

            <td id=al>MutS domain V. This domain is found in proteins of the MutS family (DNA mismatch repair proteins) and is found associated with pfam01624, pfam05188, pfam05192 and pfam05190. The mutS family of proteins is named after the Salmonella typhimurium MutS protein involved in mismatch repair; other members of the family included the eukaryotic MSH 1,2,3, 4,5 and 6 proteins. These have various roles in DNA repair and recombination. Human MSH has been implicated in non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) and is a mismatch binding protein. The aligned region corresponds with domain V of Thermus aquaticus MutS, which contains a Walker A motif, and is structurally similar to the ATPase domain of ABC transporters.</td>
