This family includes alkylphosphonate binding domain PhnD. These domains are found in PhnD-like proteins that are predicted to function as initial receptors in hypophosphite, phosphonate, or phosphate ABC transport in archaea and eubacteria. PhnD is the periplasmic binding component of an ABC-type phosphonate uptake system (PhnCDE) that recognizes and binds phosphonate. PhnD belongs to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge. The PBP2 have been shown to bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphonate ABC transporter, periplasmic phosphonate binding protein. This model is a subset of the broader subfamily of phosphate/phosphonate binding protein ABC transporter components, TIGR01098. In this model all members of the seed have support from genomic context for association with pathways for the metabolims of phosphonates, particularly the C-P lyase system, GenProp0232. This model includes the characterized phnD gene from E. coli. Note that this model does not identify all phnD-subfamily genes with evident phosphonate context, but all sequences above the trusted context may be inferred to bind phosphonate compounds even in the absence of such context. Furthermore, there is ample evidence to suggest that many other members of the TIGR01098 subfamily have a different primary function.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphate/phosphite/phosphonate ABC transporter, periplasmic binding protein. Phosphonates are a varied class of phosphorus-containing organic compound in which a direct C-P bond is found, rather than a C-O-P linkage of the phosphorus through an oxygen atom. They may be toxic but also may be used as sources of phosphorus and energy by various bacteria. Phosphonate utilization systems typically are encoded in 14 or more genes, including a three gene ABC transporter. This family includes the periplasmic binding protein component of ABC transporters for phosphonates as well as other, related binding components for closely related substances such as phosphate and phosphite. A number of members of this family are found in genomic contexts with components of selenium metabolic processes suggestive of a role in selenate or other selenium-compound transport. A subset of this model in which nearly all members exhibit genomic context with elements of phosphonate metabolism, particularly the C-P lyase system (GenProp0232) has been built (TIGR03431) as an equivalog. Nevertheless, there are members of this subfamily (TIGR01098) which show up sporadically on a phylogenetic tree that also show phosphonate context and are most likely competent to transport phosphonates.

            <td id=al>Substrate binding domain of ABC-type nitrate/sulfonate/bicarbonate transporters, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold superfamily. This family represents the periplasmic binding proteins involved in nitrate, alkanesulfonate, and bicarbonate transport. These domains are found in eubacterial perisplamic-binding proteins that serve as initial receptors in the ABC transport of bicarbonate, nitrate, taurine, or a wide range of aliphatic sulfonates. Other closest homologs involved in thiamine (vitamin B1) biosynthetic pathway and desulfurization (DszB) are also included in this family. After binding their ligand with high affinity, they interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. These binding proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge.

This group includes Thermus thermophilus GluBP (TtGluBP) of TAXI-TRAP family and closely related proteins. TRAP transporters are ubiquitous in prokaryotes, but absent from eukaryotes. They are comprised of an SBP (substrate-binding protein) of the DctP or TAXI families and two unequally sized integral membrane components. Although TtGluBP is predicted to be an L-glutamate and/or an L-glutamine-binding protein, the substrate spectrum of TAXI proteins remains to be defined. A sequence-homology search also shows that TtGluBP shares low sequence homology with putative immunogenic proteins of uncharacterized function. The substrate-binding domain of TAXI proteins belongs to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold protein (PBP2) superfamily, whose members are involved in chemotaxis and uptake of nutrients and other small molecules from the extracellular space as a primary receptor. PBP2 typically comprises of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and tworeceptor cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.</td>

Related proteins outside the scope of this model include taurine (NH2-CH2-CH2-S03H) binding proteins, the probable sulfate ester binding protein AtsR, and the probable aromatic sulfonate binding protein AsfC. All these families make sulfur available when Cys and sulfate levels are low. Please note that phylogenetic analysis by neighbor-joining suggests that a number of sequences belonging to this family have been excluded because of scoring lower than taurine-binding proteins.
