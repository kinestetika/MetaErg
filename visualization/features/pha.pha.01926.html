            <td id=al>cd07572 Nit1, Nit 2, and related proteins, and the Nit1-like domain of NitFhit (class 10 nitrilases). This subgroup includes mammalian Nit1 and Nit2, the Nit1-like domain of the invertebrate NitFhit, and various uncharacterized bacterial and archaeal Nit-like proteins. Nit1 and Nit2 are candidate tumor suppressor proteins. In NitFhit, the Nit1-like domain is encoded as a fusion protein with the non-homologous tumor suppressor, fragile histidine triad (Fhit). Mammalian Nit1 and Fhit may affect distinct signal pathways, and both may participate in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Nit1 is a negative regulator in T cells. Overexpression of Nit2 in HeLa cells leads to a suppression of cell growth through cell cycle arrest in G2. These Nit proteins and the Nit1-like domain of NitFhit belong to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes, which depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad. This superfamily has been classified in the literature based on global and structure based sequence analysis into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13), this subgroup corresponds to class 10.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07197 Nitrilase superfamily, including nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes. This superfamily (also known as the C-N hydrolase superfamily) contains hydrolases that break carbon-nitrogen bonds; it includes nitrilases, cyanide dihydratases, aliphatic amidases, N-terminal amidases, beta-ureidopropionases, biotinidases, pantotheinase, N-carbamyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolases, the glutaminase domain of glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase, apolipoprotein N-acyltransferases, and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolases, among others. These enzymes depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad, and work through a thiol acylenzyme intermediate. Members of this superfamily generally form homomeric complexes, the basic building block of which is a homodimer. These oligomers include dimers, tetramers, hexamers, octamers, tetradecamers, octadecamers, as well as variable length helical arrangements and homo-oligomeric spirals. These proteins have roles in vitamin and co-enzyme metabolism, in detoxifying small molecules, in the synthesis of signaling molecules, and in the post-translational modification of proteins. They are used industrially, as biocatalysts in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industry, in cyanide remediation, and in the treatment of toxic effluent. This superfamily has been classified previously in the literature, based on global and structure-based sequence analysis, into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13). This hierarchy includes those thirteen classes and a few additional subfamilies. A putative distant relative, the plasmid-borne TraB family, has not been included in the hierarchy.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07576 Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434 R-amidase and related proteins (putative class 13 nitrilases). Pseudomonas sp. MCI3434 R-amidase hydrolyzes (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide to form (R)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid. It does so with strict R-stereoselectively. Its preferred substrates are carboxamide compounds which have the amino or imino group connected to their beta- or gamma-carbon. This subgroup belongs to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes, which depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad. This superfamily has been classified in the literature based on global and structure based sequence analysis into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13), class 13 represents proteins that at the time were difficult to place in a distinct similarity group. It has been suggested that this subgroup represents a new class. Members of the nitrilase superfamily generally form homomeric complexes, the basic building block of which is a homodimer.

            <td id=al>cd07568 mammalian-like beta-alanine synthase (beta-AS) and similar proteins (class 5 nitrilases). This family includes mammalian-like beta-AS (EC 3.5.1.6, also known as beta-ureidopropionase or N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine amidohydrolase). This enzyme catalyzes the third and final step in the catabolic pyrimidine catabolic pathway responsible for the degradation of uracil and thymine, the hydrolysis of N-carbamyl-beta-alanine and N-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyrate to the beta-amino acids, beta-alanine and beta-aminoisobutyrate respectively. This family belongs to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes, which depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad. This superfamily has been classified in the literature based on global and structure based sequence analysis into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13), this subgroup corresponds to class 5. Members of this superfamily generally form homomeric complexes, the basic building block of which is a homodimer. Beta-ASs from this subgroup are found in various oligomeric states, dimer (human), hexamer (calf liver), decamer (Arabidopsis and Zea mays), and in the case of  Drosophila melanogaster beta-AS, as a homooctamer assembled as a left-handed helical turn, with the possibility of higher order oligomers formed by adding dimers at either end. Rat beta-AS changes its oligomeric state (hexamer, trimer, dodecamer) in response to allosteric effectors. Eukaryotic Saccharomyces kluyveri beta-AS belongs to a different superfamily.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07565 aliphatic amidases (class 2 nitrilases). Aliphatic amidases catalyze the hydrolysis of short-chain aliphatic amides to form ammonia and the corresponding organic acid. This group includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) AmiE, the amidase from Geobacillus pallidus RAPc8 (RAPc8 amidase), and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) AmiE and AmiF. PaAimE and HpAmiE hydrolyze various very short aliphatic amides, including propionamide, acetamide and acrylamide. HpAmiF is a formamidase which specifically hydrolyzes formamide. These proteins belong to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes, which depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad. This superfamily has been classified in the literature based on global and structure based sequence analysis into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13), this subgroup corresponds to class 2.

            <td id=al>cd07564 Nitrilases, cyanide hydratase (CH)s, and similar proteins (class 1 nitrilases). Nitrilases (nitrile aminohydrolases, EC:3.5.5.1) hydrolyze nitriles (RCN) to ammonia and the corresponding carboxylic acid. Most nitrilases prefer aromatic nitriles, some prefer arylacetonitriles and others aliphatic nitriles. This group includes the nitrilase cyanide dihydratase (CDH), which hydrolyzes inorganic cyanide (HCN) to produce formate. It also includes cyanide hydratase (CH), which hydrolyzes HCN to formamide. This group includes four Arabidopsis thaliana nitrilases (Ath)NIT1-4. AthNIT1-3 have a strong substrate preference for phenylpropionitrile (PPN) and other nitriles which may originate from the breakdown of glucosinolates. The product of PPN hydrolysis, phenylacetic acid has auxin activity. AthNIT1-3 can also convert indoacetonitrile to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, auxin), but with a lower affinity and velocity. From their expression patterns, it has been speculated that NIT3 may produce IAA during the early stages of germination, and that NIT3 may produce IAA during embryo development and maturation. AthNIT4 has a strong substrate specificity for the nitrile, beta-cyano-L-alanine (Ala(CN)), an intermediate of cyanide detoxification. AthNIT4 has both a nitrilase activity and a nitrile hydratase (NHase) activity, which generate aspartic acid and asparagine respectively from Ala(CN). NHase catalyzes the hydration of nitriles to their corresponding amides. This subgroup belongs to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of belong to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes, which depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad.

            <td id=al>cd07570 Glutamine aminotransferase (GAT, glutaminase) domain of glutamine-dependent NAD synthetases (class 7 and 8 nitrilases). Glutamine-dependent NAD synthetases are bifunctional enzymes, which have an N-terminal GAT domain and a C-terminal NAD+ synthetase domain. The GAT domain is a glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2) which hydrolyses L-glutamine to L-glutamate and ammonia. The ammonia is used by the NAD+ synthetase domain in the ATP-dependent amidation of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide. Glutamine aminotransferases are categorized depending on their active site residues into different unrelated classes. This class of GAT domain belongs to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes, which depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad. This superfamily has been classified in the literature based on global and structure based sequence analysis into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13), this subgroup corresponds to classes 7 and 8. Members of this superfamily generally form homomeric complexes, the basic building block of which is a homodimer. Mycobacterium tuberculosis glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase forms a homooctamer.</td>
