            <td id=al>cd03425 The MutT pyrophosphohydrolase is a prototypical Nudix hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of nucleoside and deoxynucleoside triphosphates (NTPs and dNTPs) by substitution at a beta-phosphorus to yield a nucleotide monophosphate (NMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). This enzyme requires two divalent cations for activity; one coordinates the phosphoryl groups of the NTP/dNTP substrate, and the other coordinates to the enzyme. It also contains the Nudix motif, a highly conserved 23-residue block (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), that functions as metal binding and catalytic site. MutT pyrophosphohydrolase is important in preventing errors in DNA replication by hydrolyzing mutagenic nucleotides such as 8-oxo-dGTP (a product of oxidative damage), which can mispair with template adenine during DNA replication, to guanine nucleotides.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03431 DNA glycosylase (MutY in bacteria and hMYH in humans) is responsible for repairing misread  A*oxoG residues to C*G by removing the inappropriately paired adenine base from the DNA backbone. It belongs to the Nudix hydrolase superfamily and is important for the repair of various genotoxic lesions. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily requires a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for their activity. They are also recognized by a highly conserved 23-residue nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V). However, DNA glycosylase does not seem to contain this signature motif. DNA glycosylase consists of 2 domains: the N-terminal domain contains the catalytic properties of the enzyme and the C-terminal domain affects substrate (oxoG) binding and enzymatic turnover. The C-terminal domain is highly similar to MutT, based on secondary structure and topology, despite low sequence identity. MutT sanitizes the nucleotide precursor pool by hydrolyzing oxo-dGTP to oxo-dGMO and inorganic pyrophosphate. The similarity strongly suggests that the two proteins share a common evolutionary origin.</td>

In general, the role of the nudix hydrolase is to sanitize the nucleotide pools and to maintain cell viability, thereby serving as surveillance & "house-cleaning" enzymes. Substrate specificity is used to define families within the superfamily. Differences in substrate specificity are determined by the N-terminal extension or by residues in variable loop regions. Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in the numbers and roles of divalent cations required.</td>

Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in the numbers and roles of divalent cations required. This superfamily consists of at least nine families: IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) isomerase, ADP ribose pyrophosphatase, mutT pyrophosphohydrolase, coenzyme-A pyrophosphatase, MTH1-7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-triphosphatase, diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, NADH pyrophosphatase, GDP-mannose hydrolase and the c-terminal portion of the mutY adenine glycosylase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03673 Diadenosine hexaphosphate (Ap6A) hydrolase is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. Ap6A hydrolase specifically hydrolyzes diadenosine polyphosphates, but not ATP or diadenosine triphosphate, and it generates ATP as the product. Ap6A, the most preferred substrate, hydrolyzes to produce two ATP molecules, which is a novel hydrolysis mode for Ap6A. These results indicate that Ap6A  hydrolase is a diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolase. It requires the presence of a divalent cation, such as Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Co2+, for activity. Members of the Nudix superfamily are recognized by a highly conserved 23-residue nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), which forms a structural motif that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03427 MutT homolog-1 (MTH1) is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. MTH1, the mammalian counterpart of MutT, hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-hydroxy-ATP, to monophosphates, thereby preventing the incorporation of such oxygen radicals during replication. This is an important step in the repair mechanism in genomic and mitochondrial DNA.  Like other members of the Nudix family, it requires a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, for activity, and contain the Nudix motif, a highly conserved 23-residue block (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. MTH1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Structurally, this enzyme adopts a similar fold to MutT despite low sequence similarity outside the conserved nudix motif. The most distinctive structural difference between MutT and MTH1 is the presence of a beta-hairpin, which is absent in MutT. This results in a much deeper and narrower substrate binding pocket. Mechanistically, MTH1 contains dual specificity for nucleotides that contain 2-OH-adenine bases and those that contain 8-oxo-guanine bases.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04684 Contains a crystal structure of the Nudix hydrolase from Enterococcus faecalis, which has an unknown function. In general, members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily catalyze the hydrolysis of NUcleoside DIphosphates linked to other moieties, X. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily require a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, for their activity. They also contain a highly conserved 23-residue nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), which forms a structural motif that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. Substrates of nudix hydrolases include intact and oxidatively damaged nucleoside triphosphates, dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide-sugars and dinucleotide enzymes. These substrates are metabolites or cell signaling molecules that require regulation during different stages of the cell cycle or during periods of stress. In general, the role of the nudix hydrolase is to sanitize the nucleotide pools and to maintain cell viability, thereby serving as surveillance & "house-cleaning" enzymes. Substrate specificity is used to define families within the superfamily. Differences in substrate specificity are determined by the N-terminal extension or by residues in variable loop regions. Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in the numbers and roles of divalent cations required.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03424 ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose and a variety of additional ADP-sugar conjugates to AMP and ribose-5-phosphate. Like other members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, it requires a divalent cation, such as Mg2+, for its activity. It also contains a highly conserved 23-residue Nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V) which functions as a metal binding site/catalytic site. In addition to the Nudix motif, there are additional conserved amino acid residues, distal from the signature sequence, that correlate with substrate specificity. In humans, there are four distinct ADPRase activities, three putative cytosolic enzymes (ADPRase-I, -II, and -Mn) and a single mitochondrial enzyme (ADPRase-m). Human ADPRase-II is also referred to as NUDT5. It lacks the N-terminal target sequence unique to mitochondrial ADPRase. The different cytosolic types are distinguished by their specificities for substrate and specific requirement for metal ions. NUDT5 forms a homodimer.</td>
