            <td id=al>cd09603 Peptidase M1 family similar to aminopeptidase N catalytic domain. This family contains mostly bacterial and some archaeal M1 peptidases with smilarity to the catalytic domain of aminopeptidase N (APN; CD13; alanyl aminopeptidase; EC 3.4.11.2), a type II integral membrane protease belonging to the M1 gluzincin family. APN preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides and, in higher eukaryotes, is present in a variety of human tissues and cell types (leukocyte, fibroblast, endothelial and epithelial cells). APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases such as chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyosytis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, and is enhanced in tumor cells such as melanoma, renal, prostate, pancreas, colon, gastric and thyroid cancers. It is predominantly expressed on stem cells and on cells of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages at distinct stages of differentiation, thus considered a marker of differentiation. Thus, APN inhibition may lead to the development of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. APNs are also present in many pathogenic bacteria and represent potential drug targets. Some APNs have been used commercially, such as one from Lactococcus lactis used in the food industry. APN also serves as a receptor for coronaviruses, although the virus receptor interaction site seems to be distinct from the enzymatic site and aminopeptidase activity is not necessary for viral infection. APNs have also been extensively studied as putative Cry toxin receptors. Cry1 proteins are pore-forming toxins that bind to the midgut epithelial cell membrane of susceptible insect larvae, causing extensive damage. Several different toxins, including Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ba, Cry1Ca and Cry1Fa, have been shown to bind to APNs; however, a direct role of APN in cytotoxicity has been yet to be firmly established.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09601 Peptidase M1 aminopeptidase N catalytic domain family which includes aminopeptidase N (APN), aminopeptidase Q (APQ), tricorn interacting factor F3, and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1). This M1 peptidase family includes eukaryotic and bacterial members: the catalytic domains of aminopeptidase N (APN), aminopeptidase Q (APQ, laeverin), endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) as well as tricorn interacting factor F3. Aminopeptidase N (APN; CD13; alanyl aminopeptidase; EC 3.4.11.2), a type II integral membrane protease,  preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides and is present in a variety of human tissues and cell types (leukocyte, fibroblast, endothelial and epithelial cells). APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases such as chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyosytis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, and is enhanced in tumor cells such as melanoma, renal, prostate, pancreas, colon, gastric and thyroid cancers. It is considered a marker of differentiation since it is predominantly expressed on stem cells and on cells of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages at distinct stages of differentiation. Thus, APN inhibition may lead to the development of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. ERAP1, also known as endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing (ERAAP), adipocyte derived leucine aminopeptidase (A-LAP), or aminopeptidase regulating tumor necrosis factor receptor I (THFRI) shedding (ARTS-1), associates with the closely related ER aminopeptidase ERAP2, for the final trimming of peptides within the ER for presentation by MHC class I molecules. ERAP1 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), an inflammatory arthritis that predominantly affects the spine. ERAP1 also aids in the shedding of membrane-bound cytokine receptors. The tricorn interacting factor F3, together with factors F1 and F2, degrades the tricorn protease products, producing free amino acids, thus completing the proteasomal degradation pathway. F3 is homologous to F2, but not F1, and shows a strong preference for glutamate in the P1' position. APQ, also known as laeverin, is specifically expressed in human embryo-derived extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) that invade the uterus during early placentation. It cleaves the N-terminal amino acid of various peptides such as angiotensin III, endokinin C, and kisspeptin-10, all expressed in the placenta in large quantities. APN is a receptor for coronaviruses, although the virus receptor interaction site seems to be distinct from the enzymatic site and aminopeptidase activity is not necessary for viral infection. APNs are also putative Cry toxin receptors. Cry1 proteins are pore-forming toxins that bind to the midgut epithelial cell membrane of susceptible insect larvae, causing extensive damage. Several different toxins, including Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ba, Cry1Ca and Cry1Fa, have been shown to bind to APNs; however, a direct role of APN in cytotoxicity has been yet to be firmly established.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09595 Peptidase M1 family includes the catalytic domains of aminopeptidase N and leukotriene A4 hydrolase. The model represents the catalytic domains of M1 peptidase family members including aminopeptidase N (APN) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H). All peptidases in this family bind a single catalytic zinc ion which is tetrahedrally co-ordinated by three amino acid ligands and a water molecule that forms the nucleophile upon activation during catalysis. APN preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides and is present in a variety of human tissues and cell types. APN expression is dysregulated in many inflammatory diseases and is enhanced in numerous tumor cells, making it a lead target in the development of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. LTA4H is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing an aminopeptidase as well as an epoxide hydrolase activity. The two activities occupy different, but overlapping sites. The activity and physiological relevance of the aminopeptidase in LTA4H is as yet unknown, while the epoxide hydrolase converts leukotriene A4 (LTA4) into leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent chemotaxin that is fundamental to the inflammatory response of mammals.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09599 Peptidase M1 family including Leukotriene A4 hydrolase catalytic domain. This model represents the N-terminal catalytic domain of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H; E.C. 3.3.2.6) and the close homolog cold-active aminopeptidase (Colwellia psychrerythraea-type peptidase; ColAP), both members of the aminopeptidase M1 family. LTA4H is a bifunctional enzyme, possessing an aminopeptidase as well as an epoxide hydrolase activity. The two activities occupy different, but overlapping sites. The activity and physiological relevance of the aminopeptidase is poorly understood while the epoxide hydrolase converts leukotriene A4 (LTA4) into leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent chemotaxin that is fundamental to the inflammatory response of mammals. It accepts a variety of substrates, including some opioid, di- and tripeptides, as well as chromogenic aminoacyl-p-nitroanilide derivatives. The aminopeptidase activity of LTA4H is possibly involved in the processing of peptides related to inflammation and host defense. Kinetic analysis shows that LTA4H hydrolyzes arginyl tripeptides with high efficiency and specificity, indicating its function as an arginyl aminopeptidase. Thermodynamic characterization using different biophysical methods shows that structurally distinct inhibitors of the LTA4H occupy different regions of the binding site; while some (RB202, ARM1 and SC57461A) bind to the hydrophobic hydrolase side, both bestatin and captopril are located at the hydrophilic peptidase side. LTB4H overexpression is associated with different pathological conditions and diseases such as cystic fibrosis, coronary heart disease, sepsis, shock, connective tissue disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is also overexpressed in certain human cancers, and has been identified as a functionally important target for mediating anticancer properties of resveratrol, a well-known red wine polyphenolic compound with cancer chemopreventive activity.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09839 TATA binding protein (TBP) associated factor 2. This family includes TATA binding protein (TBP) associated factor 2 (TAF2, TBP-associated factor TAFII150, transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 2, RNA polymerase II TBP-associated factor subunit B), and has homology to the M1 gluzincin family. TAF2 is part of the TFIID multidomain subunit complex essential for transcription of most protein-encoded genes by RNA polymerase II. TAF2 is known to interact with the initiator element (Inr) found at the transcription start site of many genes, thus possibly playing a key role in promoter binding as well as start-site selection. Image analysis has shown TAF2 to form a complex with TAF1 and TBP, inferring its role in promoter recognition. Peptidases in the M1 family bind a single catalytic zinc ion which is tetrahedrally co-ordinated by three amino acid ligands and a water molecule that forms the nucleophile on activation during catalysis. TAF2, however, lacks these active site residues.</td>
