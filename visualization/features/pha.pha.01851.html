            <td id=al>TIGR02891 cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I. This large family represents subunit I's (CtaD, CoxA, CaaA) of cytochrome c oxidases of bacterial origin. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Subunits I-III form the functional core of the enzyme complex. Subunit I is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Electrons originating in cytochrome c are transferred via the copper A center of subunit II and heme a of subunit I to the bimetallic center formed by heme a3 and copper B. This cytochrome c oxidase shows proton pump activity across the membrane in addition to the electron transfer. In the bacilli an apparent split (paralogism) has created a sister clade (TIGR02882) encoding subunits (QoxA) of the aa3-type quinone oxidase complex which reacts directly with quinones, bypassing the interaction with soluble cytochrome c. This model attempts to exclude these sequences, placing them between the trusted and noise cutoffs. These families, as well as archaeal and eukaryotic cytochrome c subunit I's are included within the superfamily model, pfam00115. [Energy metabolism, Electron transport]</td>

            <td id=al>cd01662 Ubiquinol oxidase subunit I.  Ubiquinol oxidase, the terminal oxidase in the respiratory chains of aerobic bacteria, is a multi-chain transmembrane protein located in the cell membrane.  It catalyzes the reduction of O2 and simultaneously pumps protons across the membrane. The number of subunits in ubiquinol oxidase varies from two to five. Subunit I contains a heme-copper binuclear center (the active site where O2 is reduced to water) formed by a high-spin heme and a copper ion.  It also contains a low-spin heme, believed to participate in the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to the binuclear center.  For every reduction of an O2 molecule, eight protons are taken from the inside aqueous compartment and four electrons are taken from ubiquinol on the opposite side of the membrane.  The four electrons and four of the protons are used in the reduction of O2; the four remaining protons are pumped across the membrane. This charge separation of four charges contributes to the electrochemical gradient used for ATP synthesis.  Two proton channels, the D-pathway and K-pathway, leading to the binuclear center have been identified in subunit I.  It is generally believed that the channels contain water molecules that act as 'proton wires' to transfer the protons.  A well-defined pathway for the transfer of pumped protons beyond the binuclear center has not been identified.  Electrons are believed to be transferred directly from ubiquinol (the electron donor) to the low-spin heme, and directly from the low-spin heme to the binuclear center.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01663 Cytochrome C oxidase subunit I.  Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal oxidase in the respiratory chains of eukaryotes and most bacteria, is a multi-chain transmembrane protein located in the inner membrane of mitochondria and the cell membrane of prokaryotes.  It catalyzes the reduction of O2 and simultaneously pumps protons across the membrane.  The number of subunits varies from three to five in bacteria and up to 13 in mammalian mitochondria. Only subunits I and II are essential for function, but subunit III, which is also conserved, may play a role in assembly or oxygen delivery to the active site. Subunits I, II, and III of mammalian CcO are encoded within the mitochondrial genome and the remaining 10 subunits are encoded within the nuclear genome. Subunit I contains a heme-copper binuclear center (the active site where O2 is reduced to water) formed by a high-spin heme (heme a3) and a copper ion (CuB).  It also contains a low-spin heme (heme a), believed to participate in the transfer of electrons to the binuclear center.  For every reduction of an O2 molecule, eight protons are taken from the inside aqueous compartment and four electrons are taken from cytochrome c on the opposite side of the membrane.  The four electrons and four of the protons are used in the reduction of O2; the four remaining protons are pumped across the membrane.  This charge separation of four charges contributes to the electrochemical gradient used for ATP synthesis. Two proton channels, the D-pathway and K-pathway, leading to the binuclear center have been identified in subunit I.  A well-defined pathway for the transfer of pumped protons beyond the binuclear center has not been identified. Electrons are transferred from cytochrome c (the electron donor) to heme a via the CuA binuclear site in subunit II, and directly from heme a to the binuclear center.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00919 Heme-copper oxidase subunit I.  Heme-copper oxidases are transmembrane protein complexes in the respiratory chains of prokaryotes and mitochondria which catalyze the reduction of O2 and simultaneously pump protons across the membrane.  The superfamily is diverse in terms of electron donors, subunit composition, and heme types. The number of subunits varies from three to five in bacteria and up to 13 in mammalian mitochondria.  It has been proposed that Archaea acquired heme-copper oxidases through gene transfer from Gram-positive bacteria. Membership in the superfamily is defined by subunit I, which contains a heme-copper binuclear center (the active site where O2 is reduced to water) formed by a high-spin heme and a copper ion.  It also contains a low-spin heme, believed to participate in the transfer of electrons to the binuclear center.  Only subunit I is common to the entire superfamily.  For every reduction of an O2 molecule, eight protons are taken from the inside aqueous compartment and four electrons are taken from the electron donor on the opposite side of the membrane.  The four electrons and four of the protons are used in the reduction of O2; the four remaining protons are pumped across the membrane.  This charge separation of four charges contributes to the electrochemical gradient used for ATP synthesis. Two proton channels, the D-pathway and K-pathway, leading to the binuclear center have been identified in subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and ubiquinol oxidase.  A well-defined pathway for the transfer of pumped protons beyond the binuclear center has not been identified. Electron transfer occurs in two segments:  from the electron donor to the low-spin heme, and from the low-spin heme to the binuclear center.  The first segment can be a multi-step process and varies among the different families, while the second segment, a direct transfer, is consistent throughout the superfamily.</td>

Cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is the component of the aerobic respiratory chain which reacts with oxygen, reducing it to water with the concomitant transport of 4 protons across the membrane. Also known as the cytochrome bo complex, cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase contains four subunits, two heme b cofactors and a copper atom which is believed to be the oxygen active site. This complex is structurally related to the cytochrome caa3 oxidases which utilize cytochrome c as the reductant and contain heme a cofactors, as well as the intermediate form aa3 oxidases which also react directly with quinones as the reductant.

The ba3 family of heme-copper oxidases are transmembrane protein complexes in the respiratory chains of prokaryotes and some archaea which catalyze the reduction of O2 and simultaneously pump protons across the membrane.  It has been proposed that Archaea acquired heme-copper oxidases through gene transfer from Gram-positive bacteria.  The ba3 family contains oxidases that lack the conserved residues that form the D- and K-pathways in CcO and ubiquinol oxidase. Instead they contain a potential alternative K-pathway.  Additional proton channels have been proposed for this family of oxidases but none have been identified definitively.

            <td id=al>cd01661 Cytochrome cbb3 oxidase subunit I.  Cytochrome cbb3 oxidase, the terminal oxidase in the respiratory chains of proteobacteria, is a multi-chain transmembrane protein located in the cell membrane. Like other cytochrome oxidases, it catalyzes the reduction of O2 and simultaneously pumps protons across the membrane.  Found mainly in proteobacteria, cbb3 is believed to be a modern enzyme that has evolved independently to perform a specialized function in microaerobic energy metabolism. Subunit I contains a heme-copper binuclear center (the active site where O2 is reduced to water) formed by a high-spin heme and a copper ion.  It also contains a low-spin heme, believed to participate in the transfer of electrons to the binuclear center.  The cbb3 operon contains four genes (ccoNOQP or fixNOQP), with ccoN coding for subunit I.  Instead of a CuA-containing subunit II analogous to other cytochrome oxidases, cbb3 utilizes subunits ccoO and ccoP, which contain one and two hemes, respectively, to transfer electrons to the binuclear center.  The fourth subunit (ccoQ) has been shown to protect the core complex from proteolytic degradation by serine proteases.  For every reduction of an O2 molecule, eight protons are taken from the inside aqueous compartment and four electrons are taken from cytochrome c on the opposite side of the membrane.  The four electrons and four of the protons are used in the reduction of O2; the four remaining protons are pumped across the membrane.  This charge separation of four charges contributes to the electrochemical gradient used for ATP synthesis. The polar residues that form the D- and K-pathways in subunit I of other cytochrome c and ubiquinol oxidases are absent in cbb3.  The proton pathways remain undefined.  A pathway for the transfer of pumped protons beyond the binuclear center also remains undefined.  It is believed that electrons are passed from cytochrome c (the electron donor) to the low-spin heme via ccoP and ccoO, respectively, and directly from the low-spin heme to the binuclear center.</td>
