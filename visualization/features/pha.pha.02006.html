Protein convertases, whose members include furins and kexins, are members of the peptidase S8 or Subtilase clan of proteases. They have an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad that is not homologous to trypsin. Kexins are involved in the activation of peptide hormones, growth factors, and viral proteins.  Furin cleaves cell surface vasoactive peptides and proteins involved in cardiovascular tissue remodeling in the TGN, at cell surface, or in endosomes but rarely in the ER.  Furin also plays a key role in blood pressure regulation though the activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. High specificity is seen for cleavage after dibasic (Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg) or multiple basic residues in protein convertases.  There is also strong sequence conservation.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07484 Peptidase S8 family domain in Thermitase-like proteins. Thermitase is a non-specific, trypsin-related serine protease with a very high specific activity.  It contains a subtilisin like domain. The tertiary structure of thermitase is similar to that of subtilisin BPN'.  It contains a Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad. Members of the peptidases S8 (subtilisin and kexin) and S53 (sedolisin) clan include endopeptidases and  exopeptidases. The S8 family has an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. Serine acts as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base. The S53 family contains a catalytic triad Glu/Asp/Ser with an additional acidic residue Asp in the oxyanion hole, similar to that of subtilisin.  The serine residue here is the nucleophilic equivalent of the serine residue in the S8 family, while glutamic acid has the same role here as the histidine  base.   However, the aspartic acid residue that acts as an electrophile  is quite different.  In S53 the it follows glutamic acid, while in S8 it precedes histidine. The stability of these enzymes may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity.  There is a great diversity in the characteristics of their members: some contain disulfide bonds, some are intracellular while others are extracellular, some function at extreme temperatures, and others at high or low pH values.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07477 Peptidase S8 family domain in Subtilisin proteins. This group is composed of many different subtilisins: Pro-TK-subtilisin, subtilisin Carlsberg, serine protease Pb92 subtilisin, and BPN subtilisins just to name a few. Pro-TK-subtilisin is a serine protease from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis and consists of a signal peptide, a propeptide, and a mature domain.  TK-subtilisin is matured from pro-TK-subtilisin upon autoprocessing and degradation of the propeptide. Unlike other subtilisins though, the folding of the unprocessed form of pro-TK-subtilisin is induced by Ca2+ binding which is almost completed prior to autoprocessing. Ca2+ is required for activity unlike the bacterial subtilisins. The propeptide is not required for folding of the mature domain unlike the bacterial subtilases because of the stability produced from Ca2+ binding.  Subtilisin Carlsberg is extremely similar in structure to subtilisin BPN'/Novo thought it has a 30% difference in amino acid sequence.  The substrate binding regions are also similar and 2 possible Ca2+ binding sites have been identified recently. Subtilisin Carlsberg possesses the highest commercial importance as a proteolytic additive for detergents. Serine protease Pb92, the serine protease from the alkalophilic Bacillus strain PB92, also contains two calcium ions and the overall  folding of the polypeptide chain closely resembles that of the subtilisins.   Members of the peptidases S8 and S35 clan include endopeptidases, exopeptidases and also a tripeptidyl-peptidase. The S8 family has an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. The S53 family contains a catalytic triad Glu/Asp/Ser. The stability of these enzymes may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity. Some members of this clan contain disulfide bonds. These enzymes can be intra- and extracellular, some function at extreme temperatures and pH values.</td>

Subtilases, or subtilisin-like serine proteases, have an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure (an example of convergent evolution).  Autotransporters are a superfamily of outer membrane/secreted proteins of gram-negative bacteria.  The presence of these subtilisin-like domains in these autotransporters are may enable them to be auto-catalytic and may also serve to allow them to act as a maturation protease cleaving other outer membrane proteins at the cell surface.</td>

The peptidase S8 or Subtilase clan of proteases have a Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad that is not homologous to trypsin. This CD contains several members of this clan including: PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), Proteinase_K, Proteinase_T, and other subtilisin-like serine proteases.  PCSK9 posttranslationally regulates hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) by binding to LDLRs on the cell surface, leading to their degradation. The binding site of PCSK9 has been localized to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the LDLR. Characterized Proteinases K are secreted endopeptidases with a high degree of sequence conservation.  Proteinases K are not substrate-specific and function in a wide variety of species in different pathways. It can hydrolyze keratin and other proteins with subtilisin-like specificity. The number of calcium-binding motifs found in these differ. Proteinase T is a novel proteinase from the fungus Tritirachium album Limber. The amino acid sequence of proteinase T as deduced from the nucleotide sequence is about 56% identical to that of proteinase K.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07482 Peptidase S8 family domain in Lantiobiotic (lanthionine-containing antibiotics) specific proteases. Lantiobiotic (lanthionine-containing antibiotics) specific proteases are very similar in structure to serine proteases.  Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial agents derived from ribosomally synthesised peptides with antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria. The proteases that cleave the N-terminal leader peptides from lantiobiotics include:  epiP, nsuP, mutP, and nisP.  EpiP, from Staphylococcus, is thought to cleave matured epidermin. NsuP, a dehydratase from Streptococcus and NisP, a membrane-anchored subtilisin-like serine protease from Lactococcus cleave nisin.  MutP is highly similar to epiP and nisP and is thought to process the prepeptide mutacin III of S. mutans. Members of the peptidases S8 (subtilisin and kexin) and S53 (sedolisin) clan include endopeptidases and  exopeptidases. The S8 family has an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. Serine acts as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base. The S53 family contains a catalytic triad Glu/Asp/Ser with an additional acidic residue Asp in the oxyanion hole, similar to that of subtilisin.  The serine residue here is the nucleophilic equivalent of the serine residue in the S8 family, while glutamic acid has the same role here as the histidine  base.   However, the aspartic acid residue that acts as an electrophile  is quite different.  In S53 the it follows glutamic acid, while in S8 it precedes histidine. The stability of these enzymes may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity.  There is a great diversity in the characteristics of their members: some contain disulfide bonds, some are intracellular while others are extracellular, some function at extreme temperatures, and others at high or low pH values.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07475 Peptidase S8 family domain in Streptococcal C5a peptidases. Streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCP), is a highly specific protease and adhesin/invasin.  The subtilisin-like protease domain is located at the N-terminus and contains a protease-associated domain inserted into a loop.  There are three fibronectin type III (Fn) domains at the C-terminus. SCP binds to integrins with the help of Arg-Gly-Asp motifs which are thought to stabilize conformational changes required for substrate binding.  Peptidases S8 or Subtilases are a serine endo- and exo-peptidase clan. They have an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. The stability of subtilases may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity. Some members of this clan contain disulfide bonds.

Bacillus subtilis produces and secretes proteases and other types of exoenzymes at the end of the exponential phase of growth. The ones that make up this group is known as bacillopeptidase F, encoded by bpr,  a serine protease with high esterolytic activity which is inhibited by PMSF.  Like other members of the peptidases S8 family these have a Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. The stability of these enzymes may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05562 Peptidase domain in the S53 family. Members of the peptidase S53 (sedolisin) family include endopeptidases and exopeptidases. The S53 family contains a catalytic triad Glu/Asp/Ser with an additional acidic residue Asp in the oxyanion hole, similar to that of Asn in subtilisin. The stability of these enzymes may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity. Some members of this clan contain disulfide bonds. These enzymes can be intra- and extracellular, some function at extreme temperatures and pH values. Characterized sedolisins include Kumamolisin, an extracellular calcium-dependent thermostable endopeptidase from Bacillus. The enzyme is synthesized with a 188 amino acid N-terminal preprotein region which is cleaved after the extraction into the extracellular space with low pH. One kumamolysin paralog, kumamolisin-As, is believed to be a collagenase. TPP1 is a serine protease that functions as a tripeptidyl exopeptidase as well as an endopeptidase. Less is known about PSCP from Pseudomonas which is thought to be an aspartic proteinase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07476 Peptidase S8 family domain in Thiazoline oxidase/subtilisin-like proteases. Thiazoline oxidase/subtilisin-like protease is produced by the symbiotic bacteria Prochloron spp. that inhabit didemnid family ascidians.  The cyclic peptides of the patellamide class found in didemnid extracts are now known to be synthesized by the Prochloron spp.  The prepatellamide is heterocyclized to form thiazole and oxazoline rings and the peptide is cleaved to form the two cyclic patellamides A and C.  Subtilases, or subtilisin-like serine proteases, have an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure (an example of convergent evolution).</td>
