            <td id=al>TIGR01591 formate dehydrogenase, alpha subunit, archaeal-type. This model describes a subset of formate dehydrogenase alpha chains found mainly archaea but also in alpha and gamma proteobacteria and a small number of gram positive bacteria. The alpha chain contains domains for molybdopterin dinucleotide binding and molybdopterin oxidoreductase (pfam01568 and pfam00384, respectively). The holo-enzyme also contains beta and gamma subunits. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of formate (produced from pyruvate during anaerobic growth) to carbon dioxide with the concomitant release of two electrons and two protons. The enzyme's purpose is to allow growth on formate in some circumstances and, in the case of FdhH in gamma proteobacteria, to pass electrons to hydrogenase (by which process acid is neutralized). This model is well-defined, with only a single fragmentary sequence falling between trusted and noise. The alpha subunit of a version of nitrate reductase is closely related.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00368 Molybdopterin-Binding (MopB) domain of the MopB superfamily of proteins, a  large, diverse, heterogeneous superfamily of enzymes that, in general, bind molybdopterin as a cofactor. The MopB domain is found in a wide variety of molybdenum- and tungsten-containing enzymes, including formate dehydrogenase-H (Fdh-H) and -N (Fdh-N), several forms of nitrate reductase (Nap, Nas, NarG), dimethylsulfoxide reductase (DMSOR), thiosulfate reductase, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, and arsenite oxidase. Molybdenum is present in most of these enzymes in the form of molybdopterin, a modified pterin ring with a dithiolene side chain, which is responsible for ligating the Mo. In many bacterial and archaeal species, molybdopterin is in the form of a dinucleotide, with two molybdopterin dinucleotide units per molybdenum. These proteins can function as monomers, heterodimers, or heterotrimers, depending on the protein and organism. Also included in the MopB superfamily is the eukaryotic/eubacterial protein domain family of the 75-kDa subunit/Nad11/NuoG (second domain) of respiratory complex 1/NADH-quinone oxidoreductase which is postulated to have lost an ancestral formate dehydrogenase activity and only vestigial sequence evidence remains of a molybdopterin binding site.</td>

Fdh-N is a membrane protein that is a complex of three different subunits and is the major electron donor to the nitrate respiratory chain. Also included in this CD is the Desulfovibrio gigas tungsten formate dehydrogenase, DgW-FDH. In contrast to Fdh-N, which is a  functional heterotrimer, DgW-FDH is a heterodimer. The DgW-FDH complex is composed of a large subunit carrying the W active site and one [4Fe-4S] center, and a small subunit that harbors a series of three [4Fe-4S] clusters as well as a putative vacant binding site for a fourth cluster. The smaller subunit is not included in this alignment. Members of the MopB_Formate-Dh-Na-like CD belong to the molybdopterin_binding (MopB) superfamily of proteins.</td>

The NDH-1 is the first energy-transducting complex in the respiratory chain and functions as a redox pump that uses the redox energy to translocate H+ ions across the membrane, resulting in a significant contribution to energy production. In Escherichia coli NDH-1, the largest subunit is encoded by the nuoG gene, and is part of the 14 distinct subunits constituting the functional enzyme. The NuoG subunit is made of two domains: the first contains three binding sites for FeS clusters (the fer2 domain), the second domain (this CD), is of unknown function or, as postulated, has lost an ancestral formate dehydrogenase activity that became redundant during the evolution of the complex I enzyme. Unique to this group, compared to the other prokaryotic and eukaryotic groups in this domain protein family (NADH-Q-OR-NuoG2), is an N-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster (N7/N1c) present in the second domain. Although only vestigial sequence evidence remains of a molybdopterin binding site, this protein domain belongs to the molybdopterin_binding (MopB) superfamily of proteins.</td>

The formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase catalyzes the first step in methane formation from CO2 in methanogenic archaea and has a molybdopterin dinucleotide cofactor. This domain corresponds to the C-terminal domain IV in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)reductase which interacts with the 2-amino pyrimidone ring of both molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide molecules.</td>

DMSOR catalyzes the reduction of DMSO to dimethylsulfide, but its cellular location and oligomerization state are organism-dependent. For example, in Rhodobacter sphaeriodes and Rhodobacter capsulatus, it is an 82-kDa monomeric soluble protein found in the periplasmic space; in E. coli, it is membrane-bound and exists as a heterotrimer. BSOR catalyzes the reduction of biotin sulfixode to biotin, and is unique among Mo enzymes because no additional auxiliary proteins or cofactors are required. TMAOR is similar to DMSOR, but its only natural substrate is TMAO. Also included in this group is the pyrogallol-phloroglucinol transhydroxylase from Pelobacter acidigallici. Members of the MopB_DMSOR-like CD belong to the molybdopterin_binding (MopB) superfamily of proteins.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02792 Formate dehydrogenase N, alpha subunit (Formate-Dh-Na) is a major component of nitrate respiration in bacteria such as in the E. coli formate dehydrogenase N (Fdh-N). Fdh-N is a membrane protein that is a complex of three different subunits and is the major electron donor to the nitrate respiratory chain. Also included in this CD is the Desulfovibrio gigas tungsten formate dehydrogenase, DgW-FDH. In contrast to Fdh-N, which is a  functional heterotrimer, DgW-FDH is a heterodimer. The DgW-FDH complex is composed of a large subunit carrying the W active site and one [4Fe-4S] center, and a small subunit that harbors a series of three [4Fe-4S] clusters as well as a putative vacant binding site for a fourth cluster. The smaller subunit is not included in this alignment. This CD (MopB_CT_Formate-Dh-Na-like) is of the conserved molybdopterin_binding C-terminal (MopB_CT) region present in many, but not all, MopB homologs.</td>

Under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, E. coli synthesizes the cytoplasmic membrane-bound quinol-nitrate oxidoreductase (NarGHI), which reduces nitrate to nitrite and forms part of a redox loop generating a proton-motive force. Found in prokaryotes and some archaea, NarGHI usually functions as a heterotrimer. The alpha chain contains the molybdenum cofactor-containing Mo-bisMGD catalytic subunit.

            <td id=al>cd02775 Molybdopterin-Binding, C-terminal (MopB_CT) domain of the MopB superfamily of proteins, a  large, diverse, heterogeneous superfamily of enzymes that, in general, bind molybdopterin as a cofactor. The MopB domain is found in a wide variety of molybdenum- and tungsten-containing enzymes, including formate dehydrogenase-H (Fdh-H) and -N (Fdh-N), several forms of nitrate reductase (Nap, Nas, NarG), dimethylsulfoxide reductase (DMSOR), thiosulfate reductase, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, and arsenite oxidase. Molybdenum is present in most of these enzymes in the form of molybdopterin, a modified pterin ring with a dithiolene side chain, which is responsible for ligating the Mo. In many bacterial and archaeal species, molybdopterin is in the form of a dinucleotide, with two molybdopterin dinucleotide units per molybdenum. These proteins can function as monomers, heterodimers, or heterotrimers, depending on the protein and organism. Also included in the MopB superfamily is the eukaryotic/eubacterial protein domain family of the 75-kDa subunit/Nad11/NuoG (second domain) of respiratory complex 1/NADH-quinone oxidoreductase which is postulated to have lost an ancestral formate dehydrogenase activity and only vestigial sequence evidence remains of a molybdopterin binding site. This hierarchy is of the conserved MopB_CT domain present in many, but not all, MopB homologs.</td>

DMSOR always catalyzes the reduction of DMSO to dimethylsulfide, but its cellular location and oligomerization state are organism-dependent. For example, in Rhodobacter sphaeriodes and Rhodobacter capsulatus, it is an 82-kDa monomeric soluble protein found in the periplasmic space; in E. coli, it is membrane-bound and exists as a heterotrimer. BSOR catalyzes the reduction of biotin sulfixode to biotin, and is unique among Mo enzymes because no additional auxiliary proteins or cofactors are required. TMAOR is similar to DMSOR, but its only natural substrate is TMAO. Members of this CD belong to the molybdopterin_binding (MopB) superfamily of proteins.</td>

The NADH-Q-OR is the first energy-transducting complex in the respiratory chains of many prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Mitochondrial complex I and its bacterial counterpart, NDH-1, function as a redox pump that uses the redox energy to translocate H+ ions across the membrane, resulting in a significant contribution to energy production. The atomic structure of complex I is not known and the mechanisms of electron transfer and proton pumping are not established. The nad11 gene codes for the largest (75-kDa) subunit of the mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, it constitutes the electron input part of the enzyme, or the so-called NADH dehydrogenase fragment. In Escherichia coli, this subunit is encoded by the nuoG gene, and is part of the 14 distinct subunits constituting the 'minimal' functional enzyme. The nad11 gene is nuclear-encoded in animals, plants, and fungi, but is still encoded in the mitochondrial genome of some protists. The Nad11/NuoG subunit is made of two domains: the first contains three binding sites for FeS clusters (the fer2 domain), the second domain (this CD), is of unknown function or, as postulated, has lost an ancestral formate dehydrogenase activity that became redundant during the evolution of the complex I enzyme. Although only vestigial sequence evidence remains of a molybdopterin binding site, this protein domain family belongs to the molybdopterin_binding (MopB) superfamily of proteins. Bacterial type II NADH-quinone oxidoreductases and NQR-type sodium-motive NADH-quinone oxidoreductases are not homologs of this domain family.</td>
