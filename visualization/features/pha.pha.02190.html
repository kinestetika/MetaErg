This family contains the histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domains of various two-component hybrid sensor histidine kinases (HKs), including the following Escherichia coli HKs: EvgS, a HK of the EvgS-EvgA two-component system (TCS) that confers acid resistance; ArcB, a HK of the ArcB-ArcA TCS that modulates the expression of numerous genes in response to respiratory growth conditions; TorS, a HK of the TorS-TorR TCS which is involved in the anaerobic utilization of trimethylamine-N-oxide; BarA, a HK of the BarA-UvrY TCS involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism; and RcsC, a HK of the RcsB-RcsC TCS which regulates the expression of the capsule operon and of the cell division gene ftsZ. Proteins having this HATPase domain also contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA), with most having accessory sensor domain(s) such as GAF, PAS and CHASE; many are hybrid sensor histidine kinases as they also contain a REC signal receiver domain.</td>

            <td id=al>GAF domain. This domain is present in cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases, adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, phytochromes, FhlA and NifA. Adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases catalyze ATP and GTP to the second messengers cAMP and cGMP, respectively, these products up-regulating catalytic activity by binding to the regulatory GAF domain(s). The opposite hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by phosphodiesterase. cGMP-dependent 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase catalyzes the conversion of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate to guanosine 5'-phosphate. Here too, cGMP regulates catalytic activity by GAF-domain binding. Phytochromes are regulatory photoreceptors in plants and bacteria which exist in two thermally-stable states that are reversibly inter-convertible by light: the Pr state absorbs maximally in the red region of the spectrum, while the Pfr state absorbs maximally in the far-red region. This domain is also found in FhlA (formate hydrogen lyase transcriptional activator) and NifA, a transcriptional activator which is required for activation of most Nif operons which are directly involved in nitrogen fixation. NifA interacts with sigma-54.</td>

TorS works together with the inducer-binding protein TorT and the response regulator TorR. TorS contains histidine kinase ATPase (pfam02518), HAMP (pfam00672), phosphoacceptor (pfam00512), and phosphotransfer (pfam01627) domains and a response regulator receiver domain (pfam00072).

            <td id=al>Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoR. This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli or Vibrio cholera PhoR, the histidine kinase (HK) of PhoB-PhoR a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) involved in phosphate regulation. PhoR monitors extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability and PhoB, the response regulator, regulates transcription of genes of the phosphate regulon. PhoR is a bifunctional histidine autokinase/phospho-PhoB phosphatase; in phosphate deficiency, it autophosphorylates and Pi is transferred to PhoB, and when environmental Pi is abundant, it removes the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated PhoB. Other roles of PhoB-PhoR TCS have been described, including motility, biofilm formation, intestinal colonization, and virulence in V. cholera. E.coli PhoR and Bacillus subtilis PhoR (whose HATPase domain belongs to a different family) sense very different signals in each bacterium. In E. coli the PhoR signal comes from phosphate transport mediated by the PstSCAB2 phosphate transporter and the PhoU chaperone-like protein while in B. subtilis, the PhoR activation signal comes from wall teichoic acid (WTA) metabolism.</td>

They subsequently transfer the phosphoryl group to the Asp acceptor residue of a response regulator protein. Two-component signalling systems, consisting of a histidine protein kinase that senses a signal input and a response regulator that mediates the output, are ancient and evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanisms in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.</td>
