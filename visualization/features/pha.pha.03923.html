            <td id=al>cd11593 Agmatinase and related proteins. This family includes known and predicted bacterial and archaeal agmatinase (agmatine ureohydrolase; AUH; SpeB; EC=3.5.3.11), a binuclear manganese metalloenzyme that belongs to the ureohydrolase superfamily. It is a key enzyme in the synthesis of polyamine putrescine; it catalyzes hydrolysis of agmatine to yield urea and putrescine, the precursor for biosynthesis of higher polyamines, spermidine, and spermine. As compared to E. coli where two paths to putrescine exist, via decarboxylation of an amino acid, ornithine or arginine, a single path is found in Bacillus subtilis, where polyamine synthesis starts with agmatine; the speE and speB encode spermidine synthase and agmatinase, respectively. The level of agmatinase synthesis is very low, allowing strict control on the synthesis of putrescine and therefore, of all polyamines, consistent with polyamine levels in the cell. This subfamily belongs to the ureohydrolase superfamily, which includes arginase, agmatinase, proclavaminate amidinohydrolase, and formiminoglutamase.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR01230 agmatinase. Members of this family include known and predicted examples of agmatinase (agmatine ureohydrolase). The seed includes members of archaea, for which no definitive agmatinase sequence has yet been made available. However, archaeal sequences are phylogenetically close to the experimentally verified B. subtilis sequence. One species of Halobacterium has been demonstrated in vitro to produce agmatine from arginine, but no putrescine from ornithine, suggesting that arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase, rather than arginase and ornithine decarboxylase, lead from Arg to polyamine biosynthesis. Note: a history of early misannotation of members of this family is detailed in PUBMED:10931887.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09990 Agmatinase-like family. Agmatinase subfamily currently includes metalloenzymes such as agmatinase, guanidinobutyrase, guanidopropionase, formimidoylglutamase and proclavaminate amidinohydrolase. Agmatinase (agmatine ureohydrolase; SpeB; EC=3.5.3.11) is the key enzyme in the synthesis of polyamine putrescine; it catalyzes hydrolysis of agmatine to yield putrescine and urea. This enzyme has been found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, requiring divalent Mn and sometimes Zn, Co or Ca for activity. In mammals, the highest level of agmatinase mRNA was found in liver and kidney. However, catabolism of agmatine via agmatinase apparently is a not major path; it is mostly catabolized via diamine oxidase. Agmatinase has been shown to be down-regulated in tumor renal cells. Guanidinobutyrase (Gbh, EC=3.5.3.7) catalyzes hydrolysis of 4-guanidinobutanoate to yield 4-aminobutanoate and urea in arginine degradation pathway. Activity has been shown for purified enzyme from Arthrobacter sp. KUJ 8602. Additionally, guanidinobutyrase is able to hydrolyze D-arginine, 3-guanidinopropionate, 5-guanidinovaleriate and L-arginine with much less affinity, having divalent Zn ions for catalysis. Proclavaminate amidinohydrolase (Pah, EC 3.5.3.22) hydrolyzes amidinoproclavaminate to yield proclavaminate and urea in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Activity has been shown for purified enzyme from Streptomyces clavuligerus. Clavulanic acid is the effective inhibitor of beta-lactamases. This acid is used in combination with the penicillin amoxicillin to prevent antibiotic's beta-lactam rings from hydrolysis, thus keeping the antibiotics biologically active.</td>

            <td id=al>cd11592 Agmatinase-like family includes proclavaminic acid amidinohydrolase. This agmatinase subfamily contains bacterial and fungal/metazoan enzymes, including proclavaminic acid amidinohydrolase (PAH, EC 3.5.3.22) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa guanidinobutyrase (GbuA) and guanidinopropionase (GpuA). PAH hydrolyzes amidinoproclavaminate to yield proclavaminate and urea in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Clavulanic acid is an effective inhibitor of beta-lactamases and is used in combination with amoxicillin to prevent the beta-lactam rings of the antibiotic from hydrolysis and, thus keeping the antibiotic biologically active. GbuA hydrolyzes 4-guanidinobutyrate (4-GB) into 4-aminobutyrate and urea while GpuA hydrolyzes 3-guanidinopropionate (3-GP) into beta-alanine and urea. Mutation studies show that significant variations in two active site loops in these two enzymes may be important for substrate specificity. This subfamily belongs to the ureohydrolase superfamily, which includes arginase, agmatinase, proclavaminate amidinohydrolase, and formiminoglutamase.</td>

These enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of amide bond. They are involved in control of cellular levels of arginine and ornithine (both involved in protein biosynthesis, and production of creatine, polyamines, proline and nitric acid), in histidine and arginine degradation, and in clavulanic acid biosynthesis.</td>

It is a key enzyme in the synthesis of polyamine putrescine; it catalyzes hydrolysis of agmatine to yield urea and putrescine, the precursor for biosynthesis of higher polyamines, spermidine, and spermine. Agmatinase from Deinococcus radiodurans shows approximately 33% of sequence identity to human mitochondrial agmatinase. An analysis of the evolutionary relationship among ureohydrolase superfamily enzymes indicates the pathway involving arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase evolved earlier than the arginase pathway of polyamine.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09989 Arginase family. This family includes arginase, also known as arginase-like amidino hydrolase family, and related proteins. Arginase is a binuclear Mn-dependent metalloenzyme and catalyzes hydrolysis of L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea (Arg, EC 3.5.3.1), the reaction being the fifth and final step in the urea cycle, providing the path for the disposal of nitrogenous compounds. Arginase controls cellular levels of arginine and ornithine which are involved in protein biosynthesis, and in production of creatine, polyamines, proline and nitric acid. In vertebrates, at least two isozymes have been identified: type I (ARG1) cytoplasmic or hepatic liver-type arginase and type II (ARG2) mitochondrial or non-hepatic arginase. Point mutations in human arginase ARG1 gene lead to hyperargininemia with consequent mental disorders, retarded development and early death. Hyperargininemia is associated with a several-fold increase in the activity of the mitochondrial arginase (ARG2), causing persistent ureagenesis in patients. ARG2 overexpression plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of cholesterol mediated endothelial dysfunction. Thus, arginase is a therapeutic target to treat asthma, erectile dysfunction, atherosclerosis and cancer.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09987 Arginase-like and histone-like hydrolases. Arginase-like/histone-like hydrolase superfamily includes metal-dependent enzymes that belong to Arginase-like amidino hydrolase family and histone/histone-like deacetylase class I, II, IV family, respectively. These enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of amide bond. Arginases are known to be involved in control of cellular levels of arginine and ornithine, in histidine and arginine degradation and in clavulanic acid biosynthesis. Deacetylases play a role in signal transduction through histone and/or other protein modification and can repress/activate transcription of a number of different genes. They participate in different cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, embryonic development, cytokine signaling important for immune response and post-translational control of the acetyl coenzyme A synthetase. Mammalian histone deacetyases are known to be involved in progression of different tumors. Specific inhibitors of mammalian histone deacetylases are an emerging class of promising novel anticancer drugs.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09988 Formimidoylglutamase or HutE. Formimidoylglutamase (N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate formimidoylhydrolase; formiminoglutamase; N-formiminoglutamate hydrolase; N-formimino-L-glutamate formiminohydrolase; HutE; EC 3.5.3.8) is a metalloenzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate to L-glutamate and formamide. This enzyme is involved in histidine degradation, requiring Mn as a cofactor while glutathione may be required for maximal activity. In Pseudomonas PAO1, mutation studies show that histidine degradation proceeds via a 'four-step' pathway if the 'five-step' route is absent and vice versa; in the four-step pathway, formiminoglutaminase (HutE, EC 3.5.3.8) directly converts formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) to L-glutamate and formamide in a single step. Formiminoglutamase has traditionally also been referred to as HutG; however, formiminoglutamase is structurally and mechanistically unrelated to N-formyl-glutamate deformylase (also called HutG). Phylogenetic analysis has suggested that HutE was acquired by horizontal gene transfer from a Ralstonia-like ancestor.</td>
