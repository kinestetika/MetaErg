            <td id=al>cd00882 Rat sarcoma (Ras)-like superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Ras-like GTPase superfamily. The Ras-like superfamily of small GTPases consists of several families with an extremely high degree of structural and functional similarity. The Ras superfamily is divided into at least four families in eukaryotes: the Ras, Rho, Rab, and Sar1/Arf families. This superfamily also includes proteins like the GTP translation factors, Era-like GTPases, and G-alpha chain of the heterotrimeric G proteins. Members of the Ras superfamily regulate a wide variety of cellular functions: the Ras family regulates gene expression, the Rho family regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression, the Rab and Sar1/Arf families regulate vesicle trafficking, and the Ran family regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport and microtubule organization. The GTP translation factor family regulates initiation, elongation, termination, and release in translation, and the Era-like GTPase family regulates cell division, sporulation, and DNA replication. Members of the Ras superfamily are identified by the GTP binding site, which is made up of five characteristic sequence motifs, and the switch I and switch II regions.</td>

            <td id=al>pfam00735 Septin. Members of this family include CDC3, CDC10, CDC11 and CDC12/Septin. Members of this family bind GTP. As regards the septins, these are polypeptides of 30-65kDa with three characteristic GTPase motifs (G-1, G-3 and G-4) that are similar to those of the Ras family. The G-4 motif is strictly conserved with a unique septin consensus of AKAD. Most septins are thought to have at least one coiled-coil region, which in some cases is necessary for intermolecular interactions that allow septins to polymerize to form rod-shaped complexes. In turn, these are arranged into tandem arrays to form filaments. They are multifunctional proteins, with roles in cytokinesis, sporulation, germ cell development, exocytosis and apoptosis.</td>

            <td id=al>cd11383 YfjP GTPase. The Era (E. coli Ras-like protein)-like YfjP subfamily includes several uncharacterized bacterial GTPases that are similar to Era. They generally show sequence conservation in the region between the Walker A and B motifs (G1 and G3 box motifs), to the exclusion of other GTPases. Era is characterized by a distinct derivative of the KH domain (the pseudo-KH domain) which is located C-terminal to the GTPase domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01850 CDC/Septin GTPase family. Septins are a conserved family of GTP-binding proteins associated with diverse processes in dividing and non-dividing cells. They were first discovered in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a set of genes (CDC3, CDC10, CDC11 and CDC12) required for normal bud morphology. Septins are also present in metazoan cells, where they are required for cytokinesis in some systems, and implicated in a variety of other processes involving organization of the cell cortex and exocytosis. In humans, 12 septin genes generate dozens of polypeptides, many of which comprise heterooligomeric complexes. Since septin mutants are commonly defective in cytokinesis and formation of the neck formation of the neck filaments/septin rings, septins have been considered to be the primary constituents of the neck filaments. Septins belong to the GTPase superfamily for their conserved GTPase motifs and enzymatic activities.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00880 E. coli Ras-like protein (Era)-like GTPase. The Era (E. coli Ras-like protein)-like family includes several distinct subfamilies (TrmE/ThdF, FeoB, YihA (EngB), Era, and EngA/YfgK) that generally show sequence conservation in the region between the Walker A and B motifs (G1 and G3 box motifs), to the exclusion of other GTPases. TrmE is ubiquitous in bacteria and is a widespread mitochondrial protein in eukaryotes, but is absent from archaea. The yeast member of TrmE family, MSS1, is involved in mitochondrial translation; bacterial members are often present in translation-related operons. FeoB represents an unusual adaptation of GTPases for high-affinity iron (II) transport. YihA (EngB) family of GTPases is typified by the E. coli YihA, which is an essential protein involved in cell division control. Era is characterized by a distinct derivative of the KH domain (the pseudo-KH domain) which is located C-terminal to the GTPase domain. EngA and its orthologs are composed of two GTPase domains and, since the sequences of the two domains are more similar to each other than to other GTPases, it is likely that an ancient gene duplication, rather than a fusion of evolutionarily distinct GTPases, gave rise to this family.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01853 Translocon at the Outer-envelope membrane of Chloroplasts 34-like (Toc34-like). The Toc34-like (Translocon at the Outer-envelope membrane of Chloroplasts) family contains several Toc proteins, including Toc34, Toc33, Toc120, Toc159, Toc86, Toc125, and Toc90. The Toc complex at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts is a molecular machine of ~500 kDa that contains a single Toc159 protein, four Toc75 molecules, and four or five copies of Toc34. Toc64 and Toc12 are associated with the translocon, but do not appear to be part of the core complex. The Toc translocon initiates the import of nuclear-encoded preproteins from the cytosol into the organelle. Toc34 and Toc159 are both GTPases, while Toc75 is a beta-barrel integral membrane protein. Toc159 is equally distributed between a soluble cytoplasmic form and a membrane-inserted form, suggesting that assembly of the Toc complex is dynamic. Toc34 and Toc75 act sequentially to mediate docking and insertion of Toc159 resulting in assembly of the functional translocon.</td>
