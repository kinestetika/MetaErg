            <td id=al>cd05230 UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase (UGD) and related proteins, extended (e) SDRs. UGD catalyzes the formation of UDP-xylose from UDP-glucuronate; it is an extended-SDR, and has the characteristic glycine-rich NAD-binding pattern, TGXXGXXG, and active site tetrad.  Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05257 Arna decarboxylase_like, extended (e) SDRs. Decarboxylase domain of ArnA. ArnA, is an enzyme involved in the modification of outer membrane protein lipid A of gram-negative bacteria. It is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the NAD-dependent decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid and N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent formylation of UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose; its NAD-dependent decaboxylating activity is in the C-terminal 360 residues. This subgroup belongs to the extended SDR family, however the NAD binding motif is not a perfect match and the upstream Asn of the canonical active site tetrad is not conserved. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids.

In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

This subgroup contains dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase and related proteins, members of the extended-SDR family, with the characteristic Rossmann fold core region, active site tetrad and NAD(P)-binding motif. dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase is closely related to other sugar epimerases of the SDR family. dTDP-D-dlucose 4,6,-dehydratase catalyzes the second of four steps in the dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway (the dehydration of dTDP-D-glucose to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose) in the synthesis of L-rhamnose, a cell wall component of some pathogenic bacteria. In many gram negative bacteria, L-rhamnose is an important constituent of lipopoylsaccharide O-antigen. The larger N-terminal portion of dTDP-D-Glucose 4,6-dehydratase forms a Rossmann fold NAD-binding domain, while the C-terminus binds the sugar substrate. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif.

Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

This subgroup contains proteins of unknown function related to aldehyde reductase and flavonoid reductase of the extended SDR-type. Aldehyde reductase I (aka carbonyl reductase) is an NADP-binding SDR; it has an NADP-binding motif consensus that is slightly different from the canonical SDR form and lacks the Asn of the extended SDR active site tetrad. Aldehyde reductase I catalyzes the NADP-dependent  reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate. The related flavonoid reductases act in the NADP-dependent reduction of  flavonoids, ketone-containing plant secondary metabolites. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs.

Extended SDR family domains belonging to this subgroup have the characteristic active site tetrad and a fairly well-conserved NAD(P)-binding motif. 3b-HSD catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of various steroids, such as pregnenolone to progesterone, or androstenediol to testosterone. This subgroup includes an unusual bifunctional 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase from Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG26, a 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase, involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol of yeast. It also includes human 3 beta-HSD/HSD3B1 and C(27) 3beta-HSD/ [3beta-hydroxy-delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase; HSD3B7].  C(27) 3beta-HSD/HSD3B7 is a membrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum, that catalyzes the isomerization and oxidation of 7alpha-hydroxylated sterol intermediates, an early step in bile acid biosynthesis. Mutations in the human NSDHL (NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein) cause CHILD syndrome (congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects), an X-linked dominant, male-lethal trait.

Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05237 UDP-Glcnac (UDP-linked N-acetylglucosamine) inverting 4,6-dehydratase, extended (e) SDRs. UDP-Glcnac inverting 4,6-dehydratase was identified in Helicobacter pylori as the hexameric flaA1 gene product (FlaA1). FlaA1 is hexameric, possesses UDP-GlcNAc-inverting 4,6-dehydratase activity,  and catalyzes the first step in the creation of a pseudaminic acid derivative in protein glycosylation. Although this subgroup has the NADP-binding motif characteristic of extended SDRs, its members tend to have a Met substituted for the active site Tyr found in most SDR families. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide.

            <td id=al>cd05238 Escherichia coli Gne (a nucleoside-diphosphate-sugar 4-epimerase)-like, extended (e) SDRs. Nucleoside-diphosphate-sugar 4-epimerase has the characteristic active site tetrad and NAD-binding motif of the extended SDR, and is related to more specifically defined epimerases such as UDP-glucose 4 epimerase (aka UDP-galactose-4-epimerase), which catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose, the final step in Leloir galactose synthesis. This subgroup includes Escherichia coli 055:H7 Gne, a UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase, essential for O55 antigen synthesis. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs.
