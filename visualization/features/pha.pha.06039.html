This family is composed of mostly uncharacterized response regulators with similarity to the REC domains of response regulator components of two-component systems that regulates hydrogenase activity, including HupR and HoxA. HupR is part of the HupT/HupR system that controls the synthesis of the membrane-bound [NiFe]hydrogenase, HupSL, of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. It contains an N-terminal REC domain, a central sigma-54 interaction domain that lacks ATPase activity, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Members of this family contain a REC domain and various output domains including the cyclase homology domain (CHD) and the c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase domains, HD-GYP and EAL. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

HupR is part of the HupT/HupR system that controls the synthesis of the membrane-bound [NiFe]hydrogenase, HupSL, of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. It belongs to the nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) family of response regulators, which activate transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) in response to a change in the environment. HupR is an unusual member of this family as it activates transcription when unphosphorylated, and transcription is inhibited by phosphorylation. Proteins in this subfamily contain an N-terminal REC domain, a central sigma-54 interaction domain that lacks ATPase activity, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of response regulators (RRs) and pseudo response regulators (PRRs). Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of C4-dicarboxylic acid transport protein D (DctD) and similar proteins. C4-dicarboxylic acid transport protein D (DctD) is part of the two-component regulatory system DctB/DctD, which regulates C4-dicarboxylate transport via regulation of expression of the dctPQM operon and dctA. It is an activator of sigma(54)-RNA polymerase holoenzyme that uses the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to stimulate the isomerization of a closed promoter complex to an open complex capable of initiating transcription. DctD is a member of the NtrC family, characterized by a domain architecture containing an N-terminal REC domain, followed by a central sigma-54 interaction/ATPase domain, and a C-terminal DNA binding domain. The ability of the central domain to hydrolyze ATP and thus to interact effectively with a complex of RNA polymerase, sigma54, and promoter, is controlled by the phosphorylation status of the REC domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

PA4781 is involved in cyclic di-3',5'-GMP (c-di-GMP) hydrolysis/degradation in a two-step reaction via the linear intermediate pGpG to produce GMP. Its unphosphorylated REC domain prevents accessibility of c-di-GMP to the active site.

This model represents the second REC domain and similar domains. DhkD activates the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA to ensure proper prestalk and prespore patterning, tip formation, and the vertical elongation of the mound into a finger, in Dictyostelium discoideum.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CKI1 and Escherichia coli RcsC. This family is composed of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators that are sensor histidine kinases (HKs) fused with a REC domain, similar to the sensor histidine kinase CKI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) signaling that mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. MSP involves a signal being transferred from HKs via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. The CKI1 REC domain specifically interacts with the downstream signaling protein AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. The plant MSP system has evolved from the prokaryotic two-component system (TCS), which allows organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. This family also includes bacterial hybrid sensor HKs such as Escherichia coli RcsC, which is a component of the Rcs signalling pathway that controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division, and motility.

Unlike PleD which contains a REC-like adaptor domain, the second REC domain of these uncharacterized GGDEF domain proteins, described in this model, contains characteristic metal-binding and active site residues. PleD response regulators are global regulators of cell metabolism in some important human pathogens. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of DNA-binding transcriptional regulator NtrC. DNA-binding transcriptional regulator NtrC is also called nitrogen regulation protein NR(I) or nitrogen regulator I (NRI). It contains an N-terminal receiver (REC) domain, followed by a sigma-54 interaction domain, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. It is part of the two-component regulatory system NtrB/NtrC, which controls expression of the nitrogen-regulated (ntr) genes in response to nitrogen limitation. DNA-binding response regulator NtrC is phosphorylated by NtrB; phosphorylation of the N-terminal REC domain activates the central sigma-54 interaction domain and leads to the transcriptional activation from promoters that require sigma(54)-containing RNA polymerase. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of Brucella abortus CpdR and CckA, and similar domains. Two-component systems (TCSs), consisting of a sensor and a response regulator, are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by TCSs in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis and membrane transport. Response regulators share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and differ output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand, and protein-binding, or enzymatic domain. CpdR is a stand-alone REC protein. CckA is a sensor histidine kinase containing N-terminal PAS domains and a C-terminal REC domain. CpdR and CckA are components of a regulatory phosphorelay system (composed of CckA, ChpT, CtrA and CpdR) that controls Brucella abortus cell growth, division, and intracellular survival inside mammalian host cells. CckA autophosphorylates in the presence of ATP and transfers a phosphoryl group to the conserved aspartic acid residue on its C-terminal REC domain, which is relayed to the ChpT phosphotransferase. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

NtrX is a member of the NtrC family, characterized by a domain architecture containing an N-terminal REC domain, followed by a central sigma-54 interaction/ATPase domain, and a C-terminal DNA binding domain. NtrC family response regulators are sigma54-dependent transcriptional activators. Also included in this subfamily is Aquifex aeolicus NtrC4. The ability of the central domain to hydrolyze ATP and thus to interact effectively with a complex of RNA polymerase, sigma54, and promoter, is controlled by the phosphorylation status of the REC domain.
