Individual proteins of this SPFH domain superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Escherichia coli HflC is an integral membrane protein which may localize to the plasma membrane. HflC associates with another SPFH superfamily member (HflK) to form an HflKC complex. HflKC interacts with FtsH in a large complex termed the FtsH holo-enzyme. FtsH is an AAA ATP-dependent protease which exerts progressive proteolysis against membrane-embedded and soluble substrate proteins. HflKC can modulate the activity of FtsH. HflKC plays a role in the decision between lysogenic and lytic cycle growth during lambda phage infection.</td>

The conserved domain common to the SPFH superfamily has also been referred to as the Band 7 domain. Many superfamily members are associated with lipid rafts. Individual proteins of the SPFH superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Microdomains formed from flotillin proteins may in addition be dynamic units with their own regulatory functions. Flotillins have been implicated in signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton rearrangement and are known to interact with a variety of proteins. Stomatin interacts with and regulates members of the degenerin/epithelia Na+ channel family in mechanosensory cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrate neurons and participates in trafficking of Glut1 glucose transporters. Prohibitin may act as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins.

It localizes predominantly to the plasma membrane and to intracellular vesicles of the endocytic pathway, where it is present in higher order homo-oligomeric complexes (of between 9 and 12 monomers).

These microdomains, in addition to being stable scaffolds, may also be dynamic units with their own regulatory functions. Prohibitin is a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein which may act as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins. Human prohibitin forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with Bap-37 (prohibitin 2, an SPFH domain carrying homolog). This complex may protect non-assembled membrane proteins against proteolysis by the m-AAA protease.
