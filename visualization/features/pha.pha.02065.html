It controls modification of the uridine at the wobble position (U34) of tRNAs that read codons ending with A or G in the mixed codon family boxes. TrmE contains a GTPase domain that forms a canonical Ras-like fold. It functions a molecular switch GTPase, and apparently uses a conformational change associated with GTP hydrolysis to promote the tRNA modification reaction, in which the conserved cysteine in the C-terminal domain is thought to function as a catalytic residue. In bacteria that are able to survive in extremely low pH conditions, TrmE regulates glutamate-dependent acid resistance.</td>

            <td id=al>KH-domain-like of EngA bacterial GTPase enzymes, C-terminal. The KH-like domain at the C-terminus of the EngA subfamily of essential bacterial GTPases has a unique domain structure position. The two adjacent GTPase domains (GD1 and GD2), two domains of family MMR_HSR1, pfam01926, pack at either side of the C-terminal domain. This C-terminal domain resembles a KH domain but is missing the distinctive RNA recognition elements. Conserved motifs of the nucleotide binding site of GD1 are integral parts of the GD1-KH domain interface, suggesting the interactions between these two domains are directly influenced by the GTP/GDP cycling of the protein. In contrast, the GD2-KH domain interface is distal to the GDP binding site of GD2. This family has not been added to the KH clan since SCOP classifies it separately due to its missing the key KH motif/fold.</td>

It also contacts several assembly elements of the 30S subunit. Era couples cell growth with cytokinesis and plays a role in cell division and energy metabolism. Homologs have also been found in eukaryotes. Era contains two domains: the N-terminal GTPase domain and a C-terminal domain KH domain that is critical for RNA binding. Both domains are important for Era function. Era is functionally able to compensate for deletion of RbfA, a cold-shock adaptation protein that is required for efficient processing of the 16S rRNA.</td>

The Era (E. coli Ras-like protein)-like family includes several distinct subfamilies (TrmE/ThdF, FeoB, YihA (EngB), Era, and EngA/YfgK) that generally show sequence conservation in the region between the Walker A and B motifs (G1 and G3 box motifs), to the exclusion of other GTPases. TrmE is ubiquitous in bacteria and is a widespread mitochondrial protein in eukaryotes, but is absent from archaea. The yeast member of TrmE family, MSS1, is involved in mitochondrial translation; bacterial members are often present in translation-related operons. FeoB represents an unusual adaptation of GTPases for high-affinity iron (II) transport. YihA (EngB) family of GTPases is typified by the E. coli YihA, which is an essential protein involved in cell division control. Era is characterized by a distinct derivative of the KH domain (the pseudo-KH domain) which is located C-terminal to the GTPase domain. EngA and its orthologs are composed of two GTPase domains and, since the sequences of the two domains are more similar to each other than to other GTPases, it is likely that an ancient gene duplication, rather than a fusion of evolutionarily distinct GTPases, gave rise to this family.</td>

Four of these groups (Obg, DRG, YyaF/YchF, and Ygr210) are characterized by a distinct glycine-rich motif immediately following the Walker B motif (G3 box). Obg/CgtA is an essential gene that is involved in the initiation of sporulation and DNA replication in the bacteria Caulobacter and Bacillus, but its exact molecular role is unknown. Furthermore, several OBG family members possess a C-terminal RNA-binding domain, the TGS domain, which is also present in threonyl-tRNA synthetase and in bacterial guanosine polyphosphatase SpoT. Nog1 is a nucleolar protein that might function in ribosome assembly. The DRG and Nog1 subfamilies are ubiquitous in archaea and eukaryotes, the Ygr210 subfamily is present in archaea and fungi, and the Obg and YyaF/YchF subfamilies are ubiquitous in bacteria and eukaryotes. The Obg/Nog1 and DRG subfamilies appear to form one major branch of the Obg family and the Ygr210 and YchF subfamilies form another branch. No GEFs, GAPs, or GDIs for Obg have been identified.</td>

The dynamin family of large mechanochemical GTPases includes the classical dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (DLPs) that are found throughout the Eukarya. This family also includes bacterial DLPs. These proteins catalyze membrane fission during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Dynamin consists of five domains; an N-terminal G domain that binds and hydrolyzes GTP, a middle domain (MD) involved in self-assembly and oligomerization, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain responsible for interactions with the plasma membrane, GED, which is also involved in self-assembly, and a proline arginine rich domain (PRD) that interacts with SH3 domains on accessory proteins. To date, three vertebrate dynamin genes have been identified; dynamin 1, which is brain specific, mediates uptake of synaptic vesicles in presynaptic terminals; dynamin-2 is expressed ubiquitously and similarly participates in membrane fission; mutations in the MD, PH and GED domains of dynamin 2 have been linked to human diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathy and rare forms of centronuclear myopathy. Dynamin 3 participates in megakaryocyte progenitor amplification, and is also involved in cytoplasmic enlargement and the formation of the demarcation membrane system. This family also includes mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2 in mammals) that are involved in mitochondrial fusion. Dynamin oligomerizes into helical structures around the neck of budding vesicles in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner.</td>
