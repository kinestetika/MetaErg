            <td id=al>2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic-acid synthase. MenD was thought until recently to act as SHCHC synthase, but has recently been shown to act instead as SEPHCHC synthase. Conversion of SEPHCHC into SHCHC and pyruvate may occur spontaneously but is catalyzed efficiently, at least in some organisms, by MenH (see TIGR03695). 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase/SHCHC synthase (menD) is a thiamine pyrophosphate enzyme involved in menaquinone biosynthesis.

            <td id=al>Pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain of 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase (MenD) and related proteins. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP family), pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain of 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SEPHCHC) synthase (MenD) subfamily. The PYR domain is found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. Escherichia coli MenD (EcMenD) is a homotetramer (dimer-of-homodimers), having two active sites per homodimer lying between PYR and PP domains of different subunits. EcMenD catalyzes a Stetter-like conjugate addition of alpha-ketoglutarate to isochorismate, leading to the formation of SEPHCHC and carbon dioxide, this addition is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of vitamin K2 (menaquinone).</td>

SHCHC synthase plays a key role in the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway, converting isochorismate and 2-oxoglutarate to SHCHC, pyruvate and carbon dioxide. The enzyme requires TPP and a divalent metal cation for activity.</td>

            <td id=al>Pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain of POX and related proteins. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP family), pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain of pyruvate oxidase (POX) and related protiens subfamily. The PYR domain is found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. For glyoxylate carboligase, which belongs to this subfamily, but lacks this conserved glutamate, the rate of the initial TPP activation step is reduced but the ensuing steps of the enzymic reaction proceed efficiently. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites, for many the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. POX decarboxylates pyruvate, producing hydrogen peroxide and the energy-storage metabolite acetylphosphate. This subfamily includes pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and indolepyruvate decarboxylase (IPDC). PDC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and CO2 in alcoholic fermentation. IPDC plays a role in the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway in plants and various plant-associated bacteria, it catalyzes the decarboxylation of IPA to IAA. This subfamily also includes the large catalytic subunit of acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS). AHAS catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of pyruvate to give the acetohydroxyacid, 2-acetolactate, a precursor of the branched chain amino acids, valine and leucine. AHAS also catalyzes the condensation of pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate to form 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate in isoleucine biosynthesis. Methanococcus jannaschii sulfopyruvate decarboxylase (MjComDE) and phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase (PpyrDc) also belong to this subfamily. PpyrDc is a homotrimeric enzyme having the PP and PYR domains tandemly arranged on the same subunit. It functions in the biosynthesis of C-P compounds such as bialaphos tripeptide in Streptomyces hygroscopicus. MjComDE is a dodecamer having the PYR and PP domains on different subunits, it has six alpha (PYR/ComD) subunits and six beta (PP/ComE) subunits. MjComDE catalyzes the decarboxylation of sulfopyruvic acid to sulfoacetaldehyde in the coenzyme M pathway.</td>

            <td id=al>Pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent enzymes. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) family, pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain; found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this group. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. In the case of 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase (2OXO), sulfopyruvate decarboxylase (ComDE), and the E1 component of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (E1- PDHc) the PYR and PP domains appear on different subunits. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. However, for the homodimeric enzymes 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and Desulfovibrio africanus pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), each active site lies at the interface of the PYR and PP domains from the same subunit.</td>
