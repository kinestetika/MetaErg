            <td id=al>cd12126 Allophycocyanin beta subunit of the phycobilisome core. Phycobilisomes (PBSs) are the main light-harvesting complex in cyanobacteria and red algae. In general, they consist of a central core and surrounding rods and function to harvest and channel light energy toward the photosynthetic reaction centers within the membrane. They are comprised of phycobiliproteins/chromophorylated proteins (PBPs) maintained together by linker polypeptides. PBPs have different numbers of chromophores, and the basic monomer component (alpha/beta heterodimers) can further oligomerize to ring-shaped trimers (heterohexamers) and hexamers (heterododecamers). Stacked PBP hexamers form both the core and the rods of the PBS; the core is mainly made up by allophycocyanin (APC) while the rods can be composed of the PBPs phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC) and phycoerythrocyanin (PEC).</td>

In general, they consist of a central core and surrounding rods and function to harvest and channel light energy toward the photosynthetic reaction centers within the membrane. They are comprised of phycobiliproteins/chromophorylated proteins (PBPs) maintained together by linker polypeptides. PBPs have different numbers of chromophores, and the basic monomer component (alpha/beta heterodimers) can further oligomerize to ring-shaped trimers (heterohexamers) and hexamers (heterododecamers). Stacked PBP hexamers form both the core and the rods of the PBS; the core is mainly made up by allophycocyanin (APC) while the rods can be composed of the PBPs phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC) and phycoerythrocyanin (PEC). This family also contains allophycocyanin-like (Apl) proteins, which conserve the residues critical for chromophore interactions, but may not maintain the proper alpha-beta subunit interactions and tertiary structure of PBPs. The genes encoding the Apl proteins cluster with light-responsive regulatory components, so these may have photoresponsive regulatory role(s). Included in this family is the PBP-like domain of the core-membrane linker polypeptide (LCM). The LCM serves both as a terminal energy acceptor and as a linker polypeptide. Its single phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore is one of two terminal energy transmitters, and transfers excitations from the hundreds of chromophores of the PBS to the RCs. This family also includes some proteins which have glutathione-S-transferases (GST) domains N-terminal to this PBP-like domain.</td>

The beta subunits of cryptophyte PBPs share a high degree of sequence identity with both the alpha and beta subunits of the cyanobacterial and red algal PBPs, however the alpha cryptophyte subunits are shorter, and unrelated. There is only one type of PBP present in a single species, either phycocyanin or phycoerythrin, but not allophycocyanin. Structurally, phycoerythrin in cryptophytes is an alpha1alpha2betabeta dimer and not a trimer as in the PBS.</td>

It includes the M/myoglobin-like, S/sensor globin, and T/truncated globin (TrHb) families, and the phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The M family includes chimeric (FHbs/flavohemoglobins) and single-domain globins: FHbs, Ngbs/neuroglobins, Cygb/cytoglobins, GbE/avian eye specific globin E, GbX/globin X, amphibian GbY/globin Y, Mb/myoglobin, HbA/hemoglobin-alpha, HbB/hemoglobin-beta, SDgbs/single-domain globins related to FHbs, and Adgb/androglobin. The S family includes GCS/globin-coupled sensors, Pgbs/protoglobins, and SSDgbs/sensor single domain globins. The T family is classified into three main groups: TrHb1s (N), TrHb2s (O) and TrHb3s (P). The M- and S families exhibit the canonical secondary structure of hemoglobins, a 3-over-3 alpha-helical sandwich structure (3/3 Mb-fold), built by eight alpha-helical segments (named A through H). For M family Adgbs, this globin domain is permuted, such that C-H are followed by A-B. The T family globins adopt a 2-on-2 alpha-helical sandwich structure, resulting from extensive and complex modifications of the canonical 3-on-3 alpha-helical sandwich that are distributed throughout the whole protein molecule. PBPs bind the linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, phycobilin, a prosthetic group chemically and metabolically related to iron protoporphyrin IX/protoheme. Examples of other globin-like domains which bind non-heme cofactors include those of the Bacillus anthracis sporulation inhibitors pXO1-118 and pXO2-61 which bind fatty acid and halide in vitro, and the globin-like domain of Bacillus subtilis RsbRA which is presumed to channel sensory input to the C-terminal sulfate transporter/ anti-sigma factor antagonist (STAT) domain. RsbRA is a component of the sigma B-activating stressosome, and a regulator of the RNA polymerase sigma factor subunit sigma (B).</td>
