            <td id=al>glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase. This enzyme, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, is also called ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. The plant form is an alpha2,beta2 heterodimer, allosterically regulated in plants. Both subunits are homologous and included in this model. In bacteria, both homomeric forms of GlgC and more active heterodimers of GlgC and GlgD have been described. This model describes the GlgC subunit only. This enzyme appears in variants of glycogen synthesis pathways that use ADP-glucose, rather than UDP-glucose as in animals. [Energy metabolism, Biosynthesis and degradation of polysaccharides]</td>

            <td id=al>ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is involved in the biosynthesis of glycogen or starch. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase) catalyzes a very important step in the biosynthesis of alpha 1,4-glucans (glycogen or starch) in bacteria and plants: synthesis of the activated glucosyl donor, ADP-glucose, from glucose-1-phosphate and ATP.  ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is a tetrameric allosterically regulated enzyme. While a homotetramer in bacteria, in plant chloroplasts and amyloplasts, it is a heterotetramer of two different, yet evolutionary related, subunits.  There are a number of conserved regions in the sequence of bacterial and plant ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase subunits. It is a subfamily of a very diverse glycosy transferase family 2.</td>

The enzyme family includes Alpha-D-Glucose-1-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase, Mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase, and Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase.

It catalyzes the first committed and rate-limiting step in starch biosynthesis in plants and glycogen biosynthesis in bacteria. It is the enzymatic site for regulation of storage polysaccharide accumulation in plants and bacteria. The enzyme is a homotetramer, with each subunit containing an N-terminal catalytic domain that resembles a dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold and a C-terminal LbH fold domain with at 5 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X). The LbH domain is involved in cooperative allosteric regulation and oligomerization.</td>

            <td id=al>G1P_TT_long represents the long form of glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase. This family is the long form of Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase.  Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase catalyses the formation of dTDP-glucose, from dTTP and glucose 1-phosphate. It is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-rhamnose, a cell wall constituent and a feedback inhibitor of the enzyme.There are two forms of   Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase in bacteria and archeae; short form and long form.  The long form, which has an extra 50 amino acids c-terminal, is found in many species for which it serves as a sugar-activating enzyme for antibiotic biosynthesis and or other, unknown pathways, and in which dTDP-L-rhamnose is not necessarily produced.The long from enzymes also have a left-handed parallel helix domain at the c-terminus, whereas, th eshort form enzymes do not have this domain. The homotetrameric, feedback inhibited short form is found in numerous bacterial species that produce dTDP-L-rhamnose.</td>

Most members of this family contains an N-terminal catalytic domain that resembles a dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold, followed by a LbH fold domain with at least 4 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X). eIF-2B epsilon contains an additional domain of unknown function at the C-terminus.

            <td id=al>N-terminal domain of the M1P-guanylyltransferase B-isoform like proteins. GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase  (GTP: alpha-d-mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase) catalyzes the formation of GDP-d-mannose from GTP and alpha-d-mannose-1-Phosphate. It contains an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal Lefthanded-beta-Helix fold domain. GDP-d-mannose is the activated form of mannose for formation of cell wall lipoarabinomannan and various mannose-containing glycolipids and polysaccharides. The function of GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase is essential for cell wall integrity, morphogenesis and viability. Repression of GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase in yeast leads to phenotypes, such as cell lysis, defective cell wall, and failure of polarized growth and cell separation.</td>
