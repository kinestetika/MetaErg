            <td id=al>UDP-glucose 4 epimerase, subgroup 1, extended (e) SDRs. UDP-glucose 4 epimerase (aka UDP-galactose-4-epimerase), is a homodimeric extended SDR. It catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose, the final step in Leloir galactose synthesis. This subgroup has the characteristic active site tetrad and NAD-binding motif of the extended SDRs. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

This subgroup partially conserves the characteristic active site tetrad and NAD-binding motif of the extended SDRs, and has been identified as possible UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (aka UDP-galactose 4-epimerase), a homodimeric member of the extended SDR family. UDP-glucose 4-epimerase catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose, the final step in Leloir galactose synthesis. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs.

This subgroup contains dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase and related proteins, members of the extended-SDR family, with the characteristic Rossmann fold core region, active site tetrad and NAD(P)-binding motif. dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase is closely related to other sugar epimerases of the SDR family. dTDP-D-dlucose 4,6,-dehydratase catalyzes the second of four steps in the dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway (the dehydration of dTDP-D-glucose to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose) in the synthesis of L-rhamnose, a cell wall component of some pathogenic bacteria. In many gram negative bacteria, L-rhamnose is an important constituent of lipopoylsaccharide O-antigen. The larger N-terminal portion of dTDP-D-Glucose 4,6-dehydratase forms a Rossmann fold NAD-binding domain, while the C-terminus binds the sugar substrate. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids.

It is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the NAD-dependent decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid and N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent formylation of UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose; its NAD-dependent decaboxylating activity is in the C-terminal 360 residues.

In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

However, while the NAD(P)-binding motif is fairly well conserved, not all members retain the canonical active site tetrad of the extended SDRs. UDP-glucose 4 epimerase (aka UDP-galactose-4-epimerase), is a homodimeric extended SDR. It catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose, the final step in Leloir galactose synthesis. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

UDP-Glcnac inverting 4,6-dehydratase was identified in Helicobacter pylori as the hexameric flaA1 gene product (FlaA1). FlaA1 is hexameric, possesses UDP-GlcNAc-inverting 4,6-dehydratase activity,  and catalyzes the first step in the creation of a pseudaminic acid derivative in protein glycosylation.

This subgroup includes an unusual bifunctional 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase from Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG26, a 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase, involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol of yeast. It also includes human 3 beta-HSD/HSD3B1 and C(27) 3beta-HSD/ [3beta-hydroxy-delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase; HSD3B7].  C(27) 3beta-HSD/HSD3B7 is a membrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum, that catalyzes the isomerization and oxidation of 7alpha-hydroxylated sterol intermediates, an early step in bile acid biosynthesis. Mutations in the human NSDHL (NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein) cause CHILD syndrome (congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects), an X-linked dominant, male-lethal trait. Mutations in the human gene encoding C(27) 3beta-HSD underlie a rare autosomal recessive form of neonatal cholestasis. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs.

            <td id=al>aldehyde reductase, extended (e) SDRs. This subgroup contains aldehyde reductase of the extended SDR-type and related proteins. Aldehyde reductase I (aka carbonyl reductase) is an NADP-binding SDR; it has an NADP-binding motif consensus that is slightly different from the canonical SDR form and lacks the Asn of the extended SDR active site tetrad. Aldehyde reductase I catalyzes the NADP-dependent  reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

            <td id=al>atypical (a) SDRs, subgroup 1. Atypical SDRs in this subgroup are poorly defined and have been identified putatively as isoflavones reductase, sugar dehydratase, mRNA binding protein etc. Atypical SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. Members of this subgroup retain the canonical active site triad (though not the upstream Asn found in most SDRs) but have an unusual putative glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif, GGXXXXG, in the usual location. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Atypical SDRs include biliverdin IX beta reductase (BVR-B,aka flavin reductase), NMRa (a negative transcriptional regulator of various fungi), progesterone 5-beta-reductase like proteins, phenylcoumaran benzylic ether and pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases, phenylpropene synthases, eugenol synthase, triphenylmethane reductase, isoflavone reductases, and others.

This subgroup contains aldehyde reductase and flavonoid reductase of the extended SDR-type and related proteins. Proteins in this subgroup have a complete SDR-type active site tetrad and a close match to the canonical extended SDR NADP-binding motif. Aldehyde reductase I (aka carbonyl reductase) is an NADP-binding SDR; it catalyzes  the NADP-dependent  reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate.

            <td id=al>human 3beta-HSD (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) and HSD3B1(delta 5-delta 4-isomerase)-like, extended (e) SDRs. This extended-SDR subgroup includes human 3 beta-HSD/HSD3B1 and C(27) 3beta-HSD/ [3beta-hydroxy-delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase; HSD3B7], and related proteins. These proteins have the characteristic active site tetrad and NAD(P)-binding motif of extended SDRs. 3 beta-HSD catalyzes the oxidative conversion of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids to the delta 4-3-keto configuration; this activity is essential for the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. C(27) 3beta-HSD is a membrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum, it catalyzes the isomerization and oxidation of 7alpha-hydroxylated sterol intermediates, an early step in bile acid biosynthesis. Mutations in the human gene encoding C(27) 3beta-HSD underlie a rare autosomal recessive form of neonatal cholestasis. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs.
