            <td id=al>urea ABC transporter, permease protein UrtC. Members of this protein family are ABC transporter permease proteins associated with urea transport and metabolism. This protein is found in a conserved five-gene transport operon typically found adjacent to urease genes. It was shown in Cyanobacteria that disruption leads to the loss of high-affinity urea transport activity. [Transport and binding proteins, Amino acids, peptides and amines]</td>

            <td id=al>Transmembrane subunit (TM) of Escherichia coli LivM and related proteins. LivM is one of two TMs of the E. coli LIV-1/LS transporter, a Periplasmic Binding Protein (PBP)-dependent ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter involved in the uptake of branched-chain amino acids (AAs). These types of transporters generally bind type 1 PBPs. PBP-dependent ABC transporters consist of a PBP, two TMs, and two cytoplasmic ABCs, and are mainly involved in importing solutes from the environment. The solute is captured by the PBP, which delivers it to a gated translocation pathway formed by the two TMs. The two ABCs bind and hydrolyze ATP and drive the transport reaction. E. coli LivM forms a heterodimer with another TM, LivH, to generate the transmembrane pore. LivH is not included in this subgroup. The LIV-1/LS transporter is comprised of two TMs (LivM and LivH), two ABCs (LivG and LivF), and one of two alternative PBPs, LivJ (LIV-BP) or LivK (LS-BP). In addition to transporting branched-chain AAs including leucine, isoleucine and valine, the E. coli LIV-1/LS transporter is involved in the uptake of the aromatic AA, phenylalanine.</td>

            <td id=al>urea ABC transporter, permease protein UrtC, archaeal type. Members of this protein family are ABC transporter permease subunits restricted to the Archaea. Several lines of evidence suggest this protein is functionally analogous, as well as homologous, to the UrtC subunit of the Corynebacterium glutamicum urea transporter. All members of the operon show sequence similarity to urea transport subunits, the gene is located near the urease structural subunits in two of three species, and partial phylogenetic profiling identifies this permease subunit as closely matching the profile of urea utilization.</td>

The D-allose transporter may also be involved in low affinity ribose transport. These transporters generally bind type 1 PBPs.
