            <td id=al>Substrate binding domain of cystine ABC transporters; the type 2 periplasmic binding protein fold. Cystine-binding domain of periplasmic receptor-dependent ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.  Cystine is an oxidized dimeric form of cysteine that is required for optimal bacterial growth. In Bacillus subtilis, three ABC transporters, TcyJKLMN (YtmJKLMN), TcyABC (YckKJI), and YxeMNO are involved in uptake of cystine. Also, three uptake systems were identified in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, while in Escherichia coli, two transport systems seem to be involved in cystine uptake. Moreover, L-cystine limitation was shown to prevent virulence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae; thus, its L-cystine solute receptor (Ngo0372) may be suited as target for an antimicrobial vaccine. The cystine receptor belongs to the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily (PBP2).

            <td id=al>The type 2 periplasmic ligand-binding protein domain of the sensor-kinase BvgS and histidine kinase receptors, and related proteins. This family comprises the periplasmic sensor domain of the two-component sensor-kinase systems, such as the sensor protein BvgS of Bordetella pertussis and histidine kinase receptors (HisK), and uncharacterized related proteins. Typically, the two-component system consists of a membrane spanning sensor-kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. It serves as a stimulus-response coupling mechanism to enable microorganisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. The N-terminal sensing domain of the sensor kinase detects extracellular signals, such as small molecule ligands and ions, which then modulate the catalytic activity of the cytoplasmic kinase domain through a phosphorylation cascade. The periplasmic sensor domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold protein (PBP2) superfamily, whose members are involved in chemotaxis and uptake of nutrients and other small molecules from the extracellular space as a primary receptor. PBP2 typically comprises of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.

            <td id=al>The solute binding domain of YfhD proteins, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily. This subfamily includes the solute binding domain YfhD_N. These domains are found in the YfhD proteins that are predicted to function as lytic transglycosylases that cleave the glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamin in peptidoglycan, while the YfhD_N domain might act as an auxiliary or regulatory subunit.

After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two receptor cytoplasmically-located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.</td>

            <td id=al>The ligand-binding domain of ionotropic glutamate receptor family, a member of the periplasmic binding protein type II superfamily. This subfamily represents the ligand binding of ionotropic glutamate receptors. iGluRs are heterotetrameric ion channels that comprises of three functionally distinct subtypes based on their pharmacology and structural similarities:  AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), and kainate receptors.  All three types of channels are also activated by the physiological neurotransmitter, glutamate. iGluRs are concentrated at postsynaptic sites, where they exert a variety of different functions.  While this ligand-binding domain of iGluRs is structurally homologous to the periplasmic binding fold type II superfamily, the N-terminal leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP)-like domain belongs to the periplasmic-binding fold type I.</td>

            <td id=al>Putative sensor domain similar to BvgS; the type 2 periplasmic binding protein domain. BvgS is composed of two periplasmic domains homologous to bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins (PBPs), a transmembrane region followed successively by a cytoplasmic PAS (Per/ARNT/SIM), a Histidine-kinase (HK), a receiver and a Histidine phosphotransfer (Hpt) domains. The sensor protein BvgS can autophosphorylate and phosphorylate the response regulator BvgA. The BvgAS phosphorelay controls the expression of virulence factors in response to certain environmental stimuli in Bordetella pertussis. Its close homologs, Escherichia coli EvgS and Klebsiella pneumoniae KvgS, appear to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of drug efflux pumps and in countering free radical stresses and sensing iron limiting conditions, respectively. The periplasmic sensor domain of BvgS belongs to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold protein (PBP2) superfamily, whose members are involved in chemotaxis and uptake of nutrients and other small molecules from the extracellular space as a primary receptor.
