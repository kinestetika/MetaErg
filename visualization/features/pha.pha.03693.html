            <td id=al>L-iditol 2-dehydrogenase. Putative L-iditol 2-dehydrogenase based on annotation of some members in this subgroup.  L-iditol 2-dehydrogenase catalyzes the NAD+-dependent conversion of L-iditol to L-sorbose in fructose and mannose metabolism. This enzyme is related to sorbitol dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and other medium chain dehydrogenase/reductases. The zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-Zn)-like family of proteins is a diverse group of proteins related to the first identified member, class I mammalian ADH.  This group is also called the medium chain dehydrogenases/reductase family (MDR) to highlight its broad range of activities and to distinguish from the smaller short chain dehydrogenases (~ 250 amino acids vs. the ~ 350 amino acids of the MDR).  The MDR proteins have 2 domains: a C-terminal NAD(P) binding-Rossmann fold domain of a beta-alpha form and an N-terminal GroES-like catalytic domain.  The MDR group contains a host of activities, including the founding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), quinone reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, butanediol DH, ketose reductase, cinnamyl reductase, and numerous others. The zinc-dependent alcohol  dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the  NAD(P)(H)-dependent interconversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.  Active site zinc has a catalytic role, while structural zinc aids in stability.  ADH-like proteins  typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and generally have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit. The active site zinc is coordinated by a histidine, two cysteines, and a water molecule. The second zinc seems to play a structural role, affects subunit interactions, and is typically coordinated by 4 cysteines.</td>

This group contains proteins identified as sorbitol dehydrogenases and other sugar dehydrogenases of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (MDR), which includes zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase and related proteins. Sorbitol and aldose reductase are NAD(+) binding proteins of the polyol pathway, which interconverts glucose and fructose. Sorbitol dehydrogenase is tetrameric and has a single catalytic zinc per subunit. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones. Related proteins include threonine dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and butanediol dehydrogenase. The medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR) has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The N-terminal region typically has an all-beta catalytic domain. These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit. Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase is a dimeric enzyme and each subunit has two domains. The NAD binding domain is in a Rossmann fold and the catalytic domain contains a zinc ion to which substrates bind. There is a cleft between the domains that closes upon formation of the ternary complex.</td>

            <td id=al>Formaldehyde dehydrogenases. Formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) is a member of the zinc-dependent/medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.  Formaldehyde dehydrogenase (aka ADH3) may be the ancestral form of alcohol dehydrogenase, which evolved to detoxify formaldehyde.  This CD contains glutathione dependant FDH, glutathione independent FDH, and related alcohol dehydrogenases. FDH converts formaldehyde and NAD(P) to formate and NAD(P)H. The initial step in this process the spontaneous formation of a S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione adduct from formaldehyde and glutathione, followed by FDH-mediated oxidation (and detoxification) of the adduct to S-formylglutathione. Unlike typical FDH, Pseudomonas putida aldehyde-dismutating FDH (PFDH) is glutathione-independent. The medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR) have a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The N-terminal region typically has an all-beta catalytic domain. These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit.</td>

            <td id=al>6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase, N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol dehydrogenase, and other MDR family members. This group contains enzymes of the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family, including members (aka MDR) identified as 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase and N-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol dehydrogenase. 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of 6-Hydroxycyclohex-1-enecarbonyl-CoA and NAD+ to 6-Ketoxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA,NADH, and H+. This group displays the characteristic catalytic and structural zinc sites of the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation. ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which have a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form.  The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide. A GxGxxG motif after the first mononucleotide contact half allows the close contact of the coenzyme with the ADH backbone. The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology to GroES. These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain. NAD(H)-binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic  and coenzyme-binding domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding. In human ADH catalysis, the zinc ion helps coordinate the alcohol, followed by deprotonation of  a histidine, the ribose of NAD, a serine, then the alcohol, which allows the transfer of a hydride to NAD+, creating NADH and a zinc-bound aldehyde or ketone. In yeast and some bacteria, the active site zinc binds an aldehyde, polarizing it, and leading to the reverse reaction.</td>

The MDR proteins have 2 domains: a C-terminal NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold domain of an beta-alpha form and an N-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to GroES.  The MDR group contains a host of activities, including the founding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), quinone reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, butanediol DH, ketose reductase, cinnamyl reductase, and numerous others. The zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the  NAD(P)(H)-dependent interconversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.  Active site zinc has a catalytic role, while structural zinc aids in stability.  ADH-like proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and generally have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit. The active site zinc is coordinated by a histidine, two cysteines, and a water molecule. The second zinc seems to play a structural role, affects subunit interactions, and is typically coordinated by 4 cysteines.</td>

This group has the characteristic catalytic and structural zinc sites of the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation. ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form.  The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide. A GxGxxG motif after the first mononucleotide contact half allows the close contact of the coenzyme with the ADH backbone. The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology to GroES. These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain. NAD(H)-binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic  and coenzyme-binding domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding. In human ADH catalysis, the zinc ion helps coordinate the alcohol, followed by deprotonation of  a histidine, the ribose of NAD, a serine, then the alcohol, which allows the transfer of a hydride to NAD+, creating NADH and a zinc-bound aldehyde or ketone. In yeast and some bacteria, the active site zinc binds an aldehyde, polarizing it, and leading to the reverse reaction.</td>

            <td id=al>PIG3 p53-inducible quinone oxidoreductase. PIG3 p53-inducible quinone oxidoreductase, a medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family member, acts in the apoptotic pathway. PIG3 reduces ortho-quinones, but its apoptotic activity has been attributed to oxidative stress generation, since overexpression of PIG3 accumulates reactive oxygen species. PIG3 resembles the MDR family member quinone reductases, which catalyze the reduction of quinone to hydroxyquinone. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes or ketones.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.  ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form.  The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide.  A GxGxxG motif after the first mononucleotide contact half allows the close contact of the coenzyme with the ADH backbone.  The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology  to GroES.  These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site, and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.

            <td id=al>Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CAD). Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CAD), members of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, reduce cinnamaldehydes to cinnamyl alcohols in the last step of monolignal metabolism in plant cells walls. CAD binds 2 zinc ions and is NADPH- dependent. CAD family members are also found in non-plant species, e.g. in yeast where they have an aldehyde reductase activity. The medium chain dehydrogenases/reductase (MDR)/zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase-like family, which contains the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-Zn) and related proteins, is a diverse group of proteins related to the first identified member, class I mammalian ADH.  MDRs display a broad range of activities and are distinguished from the smaller short chain dehydrogenases (~ 250 amino acids vs. the ~ 350 amino acids of the MDR).  The MDR proteins have 2 domains: a C-terminal NAD(P) binding-Rossmann fold domain of a beta-alpha form and an N-terminal catalytic domain with distant homology to GroES.  The MDR group contains a host of activities, including the founding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHs), quinone reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, butanediol DH, ketose reductase, cinnamyl reductase, and numerous others. The zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the  NAD(P)(H)-dependent interconversion of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.  Active site zinc has a catalytic role, while structural zinc aids in stability.  ADH-like proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and generally have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit. The active site zinc is coordinated by a histidine, two cysteines, and a water molecule. The second zinc seems to play a structural role, affects subunit interactions, and is typically coordinated by 4 cysteines.</td>

This group contains proteins identified as alcohol dehydrogenases and glutathione-dependant formaldehyde dehydrogenases (FDH) of the zinc-dependent/medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family.  The MDR family uses NAD(H) as a cofactor in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones.  FDH converts formaldehyde and NAD to formate and NADH. The initial step in this process the spontaneous formation of a S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione adduct from formaldehyde and glutathione, followed by FDH-mediated oxidation (and detoxification) of the adduct to S-formylglutathione. The medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR) has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form. The N-terminal region typically has an all-beta catalytic domain.

Polyketide synthases produce polyketides in step by step mechanism that is similar to fatty acid synthesis. Enoyl reductase reduces a double to single bond. Erythromycin is one example of a polyketide generated by 3 complex enzymes (megasynthases). 2-enoyl thioester reductase (ETR) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent dependent conversion of trans-2-enoyl acyl carrier protein/coenzyme A (ACP/CoA) to acyl-(ACP/CoA) in fatty acid synthesis. 2-enoyl thioester reductase activity has been linked in  Candida tropicalis as essential in maintaining mitiochondrial respiratory function. This ETR family is a part of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, but lack the zinc coordination sites characteristic of the alcohol dehydrogenases in this family. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes or ketones. Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.   ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form.

            <td id=al>Liver alcohol dehydrogenase and related zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes, or ketones.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.  There are 7 vertebrate ADH 7 classes, 6 of which have been identified in humans. Class III, glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, has been identified as the primordial form and exists in diverse species, including plants, micro-organisms, vertebrates, and invertebrates. Class I, typified by  liver dehydrogenase, is an evolving form. Gene duplication and functional specialization of ADH into ADH classes and subclasses created numerous forms in vertebrates. For example, the A, B and C (formerly alpha, beta, gamma) human class I subunits have high overall structural similarity, but differ in the substrate binding pocket and therefore in substrate specificity.  In human ADH catalysis, the zinc ion helps coordinate the alcohol, followed by deprotonation of  a histidine (His-51), the ribose of NAD, a serine (Ser-48), then the alcohol, which allows the transfer of a hydride to NAD+, creating NADH and a zinc-bound aldehyde or ketone. In yeast and some bacteria, the active site zinc binds an aldehyde, polarizing it, and leading to the reverse reaction. ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of an beta-alpha form.  The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide. A GxGxxG motif after the first mononucleotide contact half allows the close contact of the coenzyme with the ADH backbone.  The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology  to GroES.  These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.  NAD(H) binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic and coenzyme-binding domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding.</td>
