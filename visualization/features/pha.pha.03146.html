            <td id=al>Aldose 1-epimerase, similar to Synechocystis Slr1438. Proteins similar to Synechocystis Slr1438 are uncharacterized members of aldose-1-epimerase superfamily. Aldose 1-epimerases or mutarotases are key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, catalyzing the interconversion of the alpha- and beta-anomers of hexose sugars such as glucose and galactose. This interconversion is an important step that allows anomer specific metabolic conversion of sugars. Studies of the catalytic mechanism of the best known member of the family, galactose mutarotase, have shown a glutamate and a histidine residue to be critical for catalysis; the glutamate serves as the active site base to initiate the reaction by removing the proton from the C-1 hydroxyl group of the sugar substrate, and the histidine as the active site acid to protonate the C-5 ring oxygen.</td>

            <td id=al>D-hexose-6-phosphate epimerase-like. D-Hexose-6-phosphate epimerase Ymr099c from Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to the large superfamily of aldose-1-epimerases. Its active site is very similar to the catalytic site of galactose mutarotase, the best studied member of the superfamily. It also contains the conserved glutamate and histidine residues that have been shown in galactose mutarotase to be critical for catalysis, the glutamate serving as the active site base to initiate the reaction by removing the proton from the C-1 hydroxyl group of the sugar substrate, and the histidine as the active site acid to protonate the C-5 ring oxygen. In addition Ymr099c contains 2 conserved arginine residues which are involved in phosphate binding, and exhibits hexose-6-phosphate mutarotase activity on glucose-6-P, galactose-6-P and mannose-6-P.</td>
