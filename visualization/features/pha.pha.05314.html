The tRNA maturase RNase Z (also known as tRNase Z or 3' tRNase) catalyzes the endonucleolytic removal of the 3' extension of the majority of tRNA precursors. Escherichia coli zinc phosphodiesterase (ZiPD, also known as ecoZ, tRNase Z, or RNase BN) is a 3' tRNA-processing endonuclease, encoded by the elaC gene. Two forms of RNase Z exist in eukaryotes, one long (ELAC2) and one short form (ELAC1), the former may have resulted from a duplication of the shorter enzyme; this subgroup includes the short form (ELAC1). Only the short form exists in bacteria.

Arylsulfatase (also known as aryl-sulfate sulfohydrolase, EC 3.1.6.1). Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora arylsulfatase AtsA may function as a glycosulfohydrolase involved with desulfation of sulfated polysaccharides, which catalyzes hydrolysis of the arylsulfate ester bond, producing the aryl compounds and inorganic sulfate.

Members of the MBL-fold metallohydrolase superfamily are mainly hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions. The class B metal beta-lactamases (MBLs) for which this fold was named perform only a small fraction of the activities included in this superfamily.Activities carried out by superfamily members include class B beta-lactamases, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases, AHL (acyl homoserine lactone) lactonases, persulfide dioxygenases, flavodiiron proteins, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors such as the Int9 and Int11 subunits of Integrator, Sdsa1-like and AtsA-like arylsulfatases, 5'-exonucleases human SNM1A and yeast Pso2p, ribonuclease J and ribonuclease Z, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, insecticide hydrolases, and proteins required for natural transformation competence. Classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, however the diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry. Some members of this subgroup are named as octanoyltransferase (also known as lipoate-protein ligase B).</td>
