            <td id=al>Peptidase family M3B, oligopeptidase F (PepF). Peptidase family M3B oligopeptidase F (PepF; Pz-peptidase B; EC 3.4.24.-) is mostly bacterial and is similar to oligoendopeptidase F from Lactococcus lactis. This enzyme hydrolyzes peptides containing between 7 and 17 amino acids with fairly broad specificity. The PepF gene is duplicated in L. lactis on the plasmid that bears it, while a shortened second copy is found in Bacillus subtilis. Most bacterial PepFs are cytoplasmic endopeptidases; however, the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens PepF oligopeptidase is a secreted protein and may facilitate the process of sporulation. Specifically, the yjbG gene encoding the homolog of the PepF1 and PepF2 oligoendopeptidases of Lactococcus lactis has been identified in Bacillus subtilis as an inhibitor of sporulation initiation when over-expressed from a multicopy plasmid.</td>

            <td id=al>M3-like Peptidases, zincin metallopeptidases, include M2_ACE,  M3A, M3B_PepF, and M32 families. The peptidase M3-like family, also called neurolysin-like family, is part of the "zincin" metallopeptidases, and includes the M2, M3 and M32 families of metallopeptidases. The M2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) is a membrane-bound, zinc-dependent dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to the potent vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin II. The M3 family is subdivided into two subfamilies: the widespread M3A, which comprises a number of high-molecular mass endo- and exopeptidases from bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi, plants and animals, and the small M3B, whose members are enzymes primarily from bacteria. Well-known mammalian/eukaryotic M3A endopeptidases are the thimet oligopeptidase (TOP; endopeptidase 3.4.24.15), neurolysin (alias endopeptidase 3.4.24.16), and the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase. The first two are intracellular oligopeptidases, which act only on relatively short substrates of less than 20 amino acid residues, while the latter cleaves N-terminal octapeptides from proteins during their import into the mitochondria. The M3A subfamily also contains several bacterial endopeptidases, called oligopeptidases A, as well as a large number of bacterial carboxypeptidases, called dipeptidyl peptidases (Dcp; Dcp II; peptidyl dipeptidase; EC 3.4.15.5). M3B subfamily consists of oligopeptidase F (PepF) which hydrolyzes peptides containing 7-17 amino acid residues with fairly broad specificity. Peptidases in the M3 family contain the HEXXH motif that forms part of the active site in conjunction with a C-terminally-located Glutamic acid (Glu) residue. A single zinc ion is ligated by the side-chains of the two Histidine (His) residues, and the more C-terminal Glu. Most of the peptidases are synthesized without signal peptides or propeptides, and function intracellularly. There are similarities to the thermostable carboxypeptidases from Pyrococcus furiosus carboxypeptidase (PfuCP), and Thermus aquaticus (TaqCP), belonging to peptidase family M32. Little is known about function of this family, including carboxypeptidases Taq and Pfu.</td>

            <td id=al>oligoendopeptidase, M3 family. This family consists of probable oligoendopeptidases in the M3 family, related to lactococcal PepF and group B streptococcal PepB (TIGR00181) but in a distinct clade with considerable sequence differences. The likely substrate is small peptides and not whole proteins, as with PepF, but members are not characterized and the activity profile may differ. Several bacteria have both a member of this family and a member of the PepF family.</td>
