            <td id=al>Substrate binding domain of ABC-type nitrate/bicarbonate transporters, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold superfamily. This subfamily includes nitrate (NrtA) and bicarbonate (CmpA) receptors. These domains are found in eubacterial perisplamic-binding proteins that serve as initial receptors in the ABC transport of bicarbonate, nitrate, taurine, or a wide range of aliphatic sulfonates, while other closest homologs are involved in thiamine (vitamin B1) biosynthetic pathway and desulfurization (DszB).  After binding their ligand with high affinity, they interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. These binding proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge. They have been shown to bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>

            <td id=al>Type 2 periplasmic binding fold superfamily. This evolutionary model and hierarchy represent the ligand-binding domains found in solute binding proteins that serve as initial receptors in the transport, signal transduction and channel gating.  The PBP2 proteins share the same architecture as periplasmic binding proteins type 1 (PBP1), but have a different topology.  They are typically comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. The origin of PBP module can be traced across the distant phyla, including eukaryotes, archebacteria, and prokaryotes.  The majority of PBP2 proteins are involved in the uptake of a variety of soluble substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the family includes ionotropic glutamate receptors and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction. The substrate binding domain of the LysR transcriptional regulators and the oligopeptide-like transport systems also contain the type 2 periplasmic binding fold and thus they are significantly homologous to that of the PBP2; however, these two families are grouped into a separate hierarchy of the PBP2 superfamily due to the large number of protein sequences.</td>

            <td id=al>Putative substrate binding domain of an ABC-type transporter similar to ThiY/THI5; the type 2 periplasmic binding protein fold. This subfamily is phylogenetically similar to ThiY, which is the periplasmic N-formyl-4-amino-5-(aminomethyl)-2-methylpyrimidine (FAMP) binding component of the ABC transport system (ThiXYZ). FAMP is imported into cell by the transporter, where it is then incorporated into the thiamin biosynthetic pathway. The closest structural homologs of ThiY are THI5, which is responsible for the synthesis of 4-amino-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P) in the thiamin biosynthetic pathway of eukaryotes, and periplasmic binding proteins involved in alkanesulfonate/nitrate and bicarbonate transport. After binding the ligand, they interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. The ThiY/THI5 proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge. They have been shown to bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>
