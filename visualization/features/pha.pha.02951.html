It is a protein unfoldase that functions in concert with the 20S proteasome by unfolding proteasome substrates and passing them on for degradation. VAT forms a homohexamer, each monomer contains two tandem ATPase domains, referred to as D1 and D2, and an N-terminal domain.

This subfamily contains ATPase subunits of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome, and of the archaeal proteasome which carry out ATP-dependent degradation of substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The eukaryotic 26S proteasome consists of a proteolytic 20S core particle (CP), and a 19S regulatory particle (RP) which provides the ATP-dependence and the specificity for ubiquitinated proteins.  In the archaea the RP is a homohexameric complex of proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN). This subfamily also includes various eukaryotic 26S subunits including, proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 2 (PSMC2, also known as S7 and MSS1) which is a member of the 19S RP and has a chaperone like activity; and proteasome 20S subunit alpha 6 (PSMA6, also known as IOTA, p27K, and PROS27) which is a member of the 20S CP.

            <td id=al>Katanin p60 ATPase-containing subunit A1. Katanin p60 ATPase-containing subunit A1 (KTNA1) is the catalytic subunit of the Katanin complex which is severs microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner, and is implicated in multiple aspects of microtubule dynamics. In addition to the p60 catalytic ATPase subunit, Katanin contains an accessory subunit (p80 or p80-like). The microtubule-severing activity of the ATPase is essential for female meiotic spindle assembly, and male gamete production; and the katanin complex severing microtubules is under tight regulation during the transition from the meiotic to mitotic stage to allow proper embryogenesis.
