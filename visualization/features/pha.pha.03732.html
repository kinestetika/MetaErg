            <td id=al>cd07940 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS), N-terminal catalytic TIM barrel domain. 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS) catalyzes an aldol-type condensation of acetyl-CoA and 2-oxoisovalerate yielding 2-isopropylmalate and CoA, the first committed step in leucine biosynthesis.  This family includes the Arabidopsis thaliana IPMS1 and IPMS2 proteins, the Glycine max GmN56 protein, and the Brassica insularis BatIMS protein.  This family also includes a group of archeal IPMS-like proteins represented by the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii AksA protein.  AksA catalyzes the condensation of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetyl-CoA to form trans-homoaconitate, one of 13 steps in the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylCoA to alpha-ketosuberate, a precursor to coenzyme B and biotin.  AksA also catalyzes the condensation of alpha-ketoadipate or alpha-ketopimelate with acetylCoA to form, respectively, the (R)-homocitrate homologs (R)-2-hydroxy-1,2,5-pentanetricarboxylic acid and (R)-2-hydroxy-1,2,6- hexanetricarboxylic acid.  This family belongs to the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily.  DRE-TIM metallolyases include 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS), alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, homocitrate synthase, citramalate synthase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, re-citrate synthase, transcarboxylase 5S, pyruvate carboxylase, AksA, and FrbC.  These members all share a conserved  triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain consisting of a core beta(8)-alpha(8) motif with the eight parallel beta strands forming an enclosed barrel surrounded by eight alpha helices.  The domain has a catalytic center containing a divalent cation-binding site formed by a cluster of invariant residues that cap the core of the barrel.  In addition, the catalytic site includes three invariant residues - an aspartate (D), an arginine (R), and a glutamate (E) - which is the basis for the domain name "DRE-TIM".</td>

FrbC (NifV) of Streptomyces rubellomurinus catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and alpha-ketoglutarate to form homocitrate and CoA, a reaction similar to one catalyzed by homocitrate synthase.  The gene encoding FrbC is one of several genes required for the biosynthesis of FR900098, a potent antimalarial antibiotic.  This protein is also required for assembly of the nitrogenase MoFe complex but its exact role is unknown.

            <td id=al>cd07942 Mycobacterium tuberculosis LeuA3 and related proteins, N-terminal catalytic TIM barrel domain. Alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA), a key enzyme in leucine biosynthesis, catalyzes the first committed step in the pathway, converting acetyl-CoA and alpha-ketoisovalerate to alpha-isopropyl malate and CoA.  Although the reaction catalyzed by LeuA is similar to that of the Arabidopsis thaliana IPMS1 protein, the two fall into phylogenetically distinct families within the same superfamily.  LeuA has and N-terminal TIM barrel catalytic domain, a helical linker domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain.  LeuA forms a homodimer in which the linker domain of one monomer sits over the catalytic domain of the other, inserting residues into the active site that may be important for catalysis.  Homologs of LeuA are found in bacteria as well as fungi.  This family includes alpha-isopropylmalate synthases I (LEU4) and II (LEU9) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  This family belongs to the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily.

            <td id=al>cd07947 Clostridium kluyveri Re-citrate synthase and related proteins, catalytic TIM barrel domain. Re-citrate synthase (Re-CS) is a Clostridium kluyveri enzyme that converts acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to citrate.  In most organisms, this reaction is catalyzed by Si-citrate synthase which is Si-face stereospecific with respect to C-2 of oxaloacetate, and phylogenetically unrelated to Re-citrate synthase.  Re-citrate synthase is also found in a few other strictly anaerobic organisms.  This family belongs to the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily.  DRE-TIM metallolyases include 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS), alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, homocitrate synthase, citramalate synthase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, re-citrate synthase, transcarboxylase 5S, pyruvate carboxylase, AksA, and FrbC.  These members all share a conserved  triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain consisting of a core beta(8)-alpha(8) motif with the eight parallel beta strands forming an enclosed barrel surrounded by eight alpha helices.  The domain has a catalytic center containing a divalent cation-binding site formed by a cluster of invariant residues that cap the core of the barrel.  In addition, the catalytic site includes three invariant residues - an aspartate (D), an arginine (R), and a glutamate (E) - which is the basis for the domain name "DRE-TIM".</td>

            <td id=al>cd07938 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, catalytic TIM barrel domain. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGL) catalyzes the cleavage of HMG-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate, one of the terminal steps in ketone body generation and leucine degradation, and is a key enzyme in the pathway that supplies metabolic fuel to extrahepatic tissues.  Mutations in HMGL cause a human autosomal recessive disorder called primary metabolic aciduria that affects ketogenesis and leucine catabolism and can be fatal due to an inability to tolerate hypoglycemia.  HMGL has a TIM barrel domain with a catalytic center containing a divalent cation-binding site formed by a cluster of invariant residues that cap the core of the barrel.  The cleavage of HMG-CoA requires the presence of a divalent cation like Mg2+ or Mn2+, and the reaction is thought to involve general acid/base catalysis.  This family belongs to the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily.  DRE-TIM metallolyases include 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS), alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, homocitrate synthase, citramalate synthase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, re-citrate synthase, transcarboxylase 5S, pyruvate carboxylase, AksA, and FrbC.

            <td id=al>cd07943 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, N-terminal catalytic TIM barrel domain. 4-hydroxy 2-ketovalerate aldolase  (Also known as 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase and 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate aldolase (HOA)) converts 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate to acetaldehyde and pyruvate, the penultimate step in the meta-cleavage pathway for the degradation of phenols, cresols and catechol.  This family includes the Escherichia coli MhpE aldolase, the Pseudomonas DmpG aldolase, and the Burkholderia xenovorans BphI pyruvate aldolase.  In Pseudomonas, the DmpG aldolase tightly associates with a dehydrogenase (DmpF ) and is inactive without it.  HOA has a canonical TIM-barrel fold with a C-terminal extension that forms a funnel leading to the active site.  This family belongs to the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily.  DRE-TIM metallolyases include 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS), alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, homocitrate synthase, citramalate synthase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, re-citrate synthase, transcarboxylase 5S, pyruvate carboxylase, AksA, and FrbC.

This family includes the Bacteroides vulgatus Bvu_2661 protein and belongs to the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily.
