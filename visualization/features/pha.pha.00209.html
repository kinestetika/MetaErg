            <td id=al>WD40 repeats in seven bladed beta propellers. The WD40 repeat is found in a number of eukaryotic proteins that cover a wide variety of functions including adaptor/regulatory modules in signal transduction, pre-mRNA processing, and cytoskeleton assembly. It typically contains a GH dipeptide 11-24 residues from its N-terminus and the WD dipeptide at its C-terminus and is 40 residues long, hence the name WD40. Between the GH and WD dipeptides lies a conserved core. It forms a propeller-like structure with several blades where each blade is composed of a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. The WD40 sequence repeat originally described in literature forms the first three strands of one blade and the last strand in the next blade. The C-terminal WD40 repeat completes the blade structure of the N-terminal WD40 repeat to create the closed ring propeller-structure. The residues on the top and bottom surface of the propeller are proposed to coordinate interactions with other proteins and/or small ligands, allowing them to bind either stably or reversibly.</td>
