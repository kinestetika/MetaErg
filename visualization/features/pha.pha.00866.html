            <td id=al>cd02947 TRX family; composed of two groups: Group I, which includes proteins that exclusively encode a TRX domain; and Group II, which are composed of fusion proteins of TRX and additional domains. Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02961 Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDIa) family, redox active TRX domains; composed of eukaryotic proteins involved in oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by acting as catalysts and folding assistants. Members of this family include PDI and PDI-related proteins like ERp72, ERp57 (or ERp60), ERp44, P5, PDIR, ERp46 and the transmembrane PDIs. PDI, ERp57, ERp72, P5, PDIR and ERp46 are all oxidases, catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds of newly synthesized polypeptides in the ER. They also exhibit reductase activity in acting as isomerases to correct any non-native disulfide bonds, as well as chaperone activity to prevent protein aggregation and facilitate the folding of newly synthesized proteins. These proteins usually contain multiple copies of a redox active TRX (a) domain containing a CXXC motif, and may also contain one or more redox inactive TRX-like (b) domains. Only one a domain is required for the oxidase function but multiple copies are necessary for the isomerase function. The different types of PDIs may show different substrate specificities and tissue-specific expression, or may be induced by stress. PDIs are in their reduced form at steady state and are oxidized to the active form by Ero1, which is localized in the ER through ERp44. Some members of this family also contain a DnaJ domain in addition to the redox active a domains; examples are ERdj5 and Pfj2. Also included in the family is the redox inactive N-terminal TRX-like domain of ERp29.</td>

Like PDI, P5 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and displays both isomerase and chaperone activities, which are independent of each other. Compared to PDI, the isomerase and chaperone activities of P5 are lower. The first cysteine in the CXXC motif of both redox active domains in P5 is necessary for isomerase activity. The P5 gene was first isolated as an amplified gene from a hydroxyurea-resistant hamster cell line. The zebrafish P5 homolog has been implicated to play a critical role in establishing left/right asymmetries in the embryonic midline. Some members of this subfamily are P5-like proteins containing only one redox active TRX domain.</td>

PICOT contains an N-terminal TRX-like domain, which does not contain the catalytic CXXC motif, followed by one to three glutaredoxin domains. The TRX-like domain is required for interaction with PKC theta.

The cDNA clone of this protein (named G1) was isolated from an alfalfa cDNA library by screening with human protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) cDNA. The G1 protein is constitutively expressed in all major organs of the plant and its expression is induced by treatment with tunicamycin, indicating that it may be a glucose-regulated protein. The G1 homolog in the eukaryotic social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is also described as a P5-like protein, which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) despite the absence of an ER-retrieval signal. G1 homologs from Aspergillus niger and Neurospora crassa have also been characterized, and are named TIGA and ERp38, respectively. Also included in the alignment is an atypical PDI from Leishmania donovani containing a single a domain, and the C-terminal a domain of a P5-like protein from Entamoeba histolytica.</td>

This subfamily is composed of the three TRX domains located at the C-terminal half of the protein. ERdj5 is a ubiquitous protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is abundant in secretory cells. It's transcription is induced during ER stress. It interacts with BiP through its DnaJ domain in an ATP-dependent manner. BiP, an ER-resident member of the Hsp70 chaperone family, functions in ER-associated degradation and protein translocation. Also included in the alignment is the single complete TRX domain of an uncharacterized protein from Tetraodon nigroviridis, which also contains a DnaJ domain at its N-terminus.</td>

MPD1 has been shown to suppress the maturation defect of carboxypeptidase Y caused by deletion of the yeast PDI1 gene. Other characterized members of this subfamily include the Aspergillus niger prpA protein and Giardia PDI-1. PrpA is non-essential to strain viability, however, its transcript level is induced by heterologous protein expression suggesting a possible role in oxidative protein folding during high protein production. Giardia PDI-1 has the ability to refold scrambled RNase and exhibits transglutaminase activity.</td>

The fusion protein is  bifunctional, showing both TRX and NTR activities, but it is not an independent NTR/TRX system. In plants, the protein is found exclusively in shoots and mature leaves and is localized in the chloroplast. It is involved in plant protection against oxidative stress.</td>

They are membrane-anchored proteins with a soluble TRX domain containing a CXXC motif located in the periplasm. The TRX domains of this family contain an insert, approximately 25 residues in length, which correspond to an extra alpha helix and a beta strand when compared with TRX. TlpA catalyzes an essential reaction in the biogenesis of cytochrome aa3, while ResA and DsbE are essential proteins in cytochrome c maturation. Also included in this family are proteins containing a TlpA-like TRX domain with domain architectures similar to E. coli DipZ protein, and the N-terminal TRX domain of PilB protein from Neisseria which acts as a disulfide reductase that can recylce methionine sulfoxide reductases.</td>

Disruption of the txlA gene suggests that the protein is involved in the redox regulation  of the structure and function of photosynthetic apparatus.

It has been detected in many tissues, however, transcript and protein levels do not correlate in all tissues, suggesting regulation at a posttranscriptional level. An identical protein, named endoPDI, has been identified as an endothelial PDI that is highly expressed in the endothelium of tumors and hypoxic lesions. It has a protective effect on cells exposed to hypoxia.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02995 PDIa family, C-terminal TRX domain (a') subfamily; composed of the C-terminal redox active a' domains of PDI, ERp72, ERp57 (or ERp60) and EFP1. PDI, ERp72 and ERp57 are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident eukaryotic proteins involved in oxidative protein folding. They are oxidases, catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds of newly synthesized polypeptides in the ER. They also exhibit reductase activity in acting as isomerases to correct any non-native disulfide bonds, as well as chaperone activity to prevent protein aggregation and facilitate the folding of newly synthesized proteins. PDI and ERp57 have the abb'a' domain structure (where a and a' are redox active TRX domains while b and b' are redox inactive TRX-like domains). PDI also contains an acidic region (c domain) after the a' domain that is absent in ERp57. ERp72 has an additional a domain at the N-terminus (a"abb'a' domain structure). ERp57 interacts with the lectin chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin, and specifically promotes the oxidative folding of glycoproteins, while PDI shows a wider substrate specificity. ERp72 associates with several ER chaperones and folding factors to form complexes in the ER that bind nascent proteins. EFP1 is a binding partner protein of thyroid oxidase, which is responsible for the generation of hydrogen peroxide, a crucial substrate of thyroperoxidase, which functions to iodinate thyroglobulin and synthesize thyroid hormones.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01659 Thioredoxin (TRX) superfamily; a large, diverse group of proteins containing a TRX-fold. Many members contain a classic TRX domain with a redox active CXXC motif. They function as protein disulfide oxidoreductases (PDOs), altering the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of their active site dithiol. The PDO members of this superfamily include TRX, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), tlpA-like, glutaredoxin, NrdH redoxin, and the bacterial Dsb (DsbA, DsbC, DsbG, DsbE, DsbDgamma) protein families. Members of the superfamily that do not function as PDOs but contain a TRX-fold domain include phosducins, peroxiredoxins and glutathione (GSH) peroxidases, SCO proteins, GSH transferases (GST, N-terminal domain), arsenic reductases, TRX-like ferredoxins and calsequestrin, among others.</td>

The Salmonella typhimurium ScsD is a thioredoxin-like protein which confers copper tolerance to copper-sensitive mutants of E. coli. MtbDsbE has been characterized as an oxidase in vitro, catalyzing the disulfide bond formation of substrates like hirudin. The reduced form of MtbDsbE is more stable than its oxidized form, consistent with an oxidase function. This is in contrast to the function of DsbE from gram-negative bacteria which is a specific reductase of apocytochrome c.</td>

It contains an N-terminal TRX domain, similar to that of PDIa, with a CXFS motif followed by two redox inactive TRX-like domains, homologous to the b and b' domains of PDI. The CXFS motif in the N-terminal domain allows ERp44 to form stable reversible mixed disulfides with its substrates. Through this activity, ERp44 mediates the ER localization of Ero1alpha, a protein that oxidizes protein disulfide isomerases into their active form. ERp44 also prevents the secretion of unassembled cargo protein with unpaired cysteines. It also modulates the activity of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate type I receptor (IP3R1), an intracellular channel protein that mediates calcium release from the ER to the cytosol.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02953 DsbD gamma family; DsbD gamma is the C-terminal periplasmic domain of the bacterial protein DsbD. It contains a CXXC motif in a TRX fold and shuttles the reducing potential from the membrane domain (DsbD beta) to the N-terminal periplasmic domain (DsbD alpha).  DsbD beta, a transmembrane domain comprising of eight helices, acquires its reducing potential from the cytoplasmic thioredoxin. DsbD alpha transfers the acquired reducing potential from DsbD gamma to target proteins such as the periplasmic protein disulphide isomerases, DsbC and DsbG. This flow of reducing potential from the cytoplasm through DsbD allows DsbC and DsbG to act as isomerases in the oxidizing environment of the bacterial periplasm. DsbD also transfers reducing potential from the cytoplasm to specific reductases in the periplasm which are involved in the maturation of cytochromes.</td>

Assembly of cytochrome c requires the ligation of heme to reduced thiols of the apocytochrome. In bacteria, this assembly occurs in the periplasm. The reductase activity of DsbE in the oxidizing environment of the periplasm is crucial in the maturation of cytochrome c.</td>

PDIR is composed of three redox active TRX (a) domains and an N-terminal redox inactive TRX-like (b) domain. Similar to PDI, it is involved in oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through its isomerase and chaperone activities. These activities are lower compared to PDI, probably due to PDIR acting only on a subset of proteins. PDIR is preferentially expressed in cells actively secreting proteins and its expression is induced by stress. Similar to PDI, the isomerase and chaperone activities of PDIR are independent; CXXC mutants lacking isomerase activity retain chaperone activity.</td>

It contains a TRX domain but the redox active CXXC motif is replaced with SXXC. Sequence analysis predicts that TMX2 may be a Type I membrane protein, with its C-terminal half protruding on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition to the TRX domain, transmembrane region and ER-retention signal, TMX2 also contains a Myb DNA-binding domain repeat signature and a dileucine motif in the tail.</td>

The gene name for the human protein is TxnDC9. The two characterized members are described as Phd-like proteins, PLP1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and PhLP3 of Dictyostelium discoideum. Gene disruption experiments show that both PLP1 and PhLP3 are non-essential proteins.

ERdj5 is a ubiquitous protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is abundant in secretory cells. It's transcription is induced during ER stress. It interacts with BiP through its DnaJ domain in an ATP-dependent manner.

It is expressed in many cell types and its active site motif (CPAC) is unique. In vitro, TMX reduces interchain disulfides of insulin and renatures inactive RNase containing incorrect disulfide bonds. The C. elegans homolog, DPY-11, is expressed only in the hypodermis and resides in the cytoplasm. It is required for body and sensory organ morphogeneis. Another uncharacterized TRX-related transmembrane protein, human TMX4, is included in the alignment. The active site sequence of TMX4 is CPSC.</td>
