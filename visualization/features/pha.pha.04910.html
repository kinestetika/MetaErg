            <td id=al>cd04606 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in the magnesium transporter, MgtE. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domain in the magnesium transporter, MgtE.  MgtE and its homologs are found in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryota. Members of this family transport Mg2+ or other divalent cations into the cell via two highly conserved aspartates. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>cd04584 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the ACT domain. The putative Acetoin Utilization Protein (Acub) from Vibrio Cholerae contains a CBS pair domain.  The acetoin utilization protein plays a role in growth and sporulation on acetoin or butanediol for use as a carbon source. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms.  It is used as an external energy store by a number of fermentive bacteria. Acetoin is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be utilised in order to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA or 2,3-butanediol is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex and acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, respectively. Acetoin utilization proteins, acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, and histone deacetylases are members of an ancient protein superfamily.This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in the acetoin utilization proteins in bacteria. Acetoin is a product of fermentative metabolism in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms.  They produce acetoin as an external carbon storage compound and then later reuse it as a carbon and energy source during their stationary phase and sporulation. In addition these CBS domains are associated with a downstream ACT (aspartate kinase/chorismate mutase/TyrA) domain, which is linked to a wide range of metabolic enzymes that are regulated by amino acid concentration. Pairs of ACT domains bind specifically to a particular amino acid leading to regulation of the linked enzyme. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins.

            <td id=al>cd04622 CBS pair domain found in Hypoxic Response Protein 1 (HRP1) -like proteinds. Mycobacterium tuberculosis adapts to cellular stresses by upregulation of the dormancy survival regulon.  Hypoxic response protein 1 (HRP1) is encoded by one of the most strongly upregulated genes in the dormancy survival regulon. HRP1 is a 'CBS-domain-only protein; however unlike other CBS containing proteins it does not appear to bind AMP. The biological function of the protein remains unclear, but is thought to contribute to the modulation of the host immune response.

            <td id=al>cd04583 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains found associated with the ABC transporter OpuCA. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains found in association with the ABC transporter OpuCA. OpuCA is the ATP binding component of a bacterial solute transporter that serves a protective role to cells growing in a hyperosmolar environment but the function of the CBS domains in OpuCA remains unknown.  In the related ABC transporter, OpuA, the tandem CBS domains have been shown to function as sensors for ionic strength, whereby they control the transport activity through an electronic switching mechanism. ABC transporters are a large family of proteins involved in the transport of a wide variety of different compounds, like sugars, ions, peptides, and more complex organic molecules. They are a subset of nucleotide hydrolases that contain a signature motif, Q-loop, and H-loop/switch region, in addition to the Walker A motif/P-loop and Walker B motif commonly found in a number of ATP- and GTP-binding and hydrolyzing proteins.

            <td id=al>pfam00571 CBS domain. CBS domains are small intracellular modules that pair together to form a stable globular domain. This family represents a single CBS domain. Pairs of these domains have been termed a Bateman domain. CBS domains have been shown to bind ligands with an adenosyl group such as AMP, ATP and S-AdoMet. CBS domains are found attached to a wide range of other protein domains suggesting that CBS domains may play a regulatory role making proteins sensitive to adenosyl carrying ligands. The region containing the CBS domains in Cystathionine-beta synthase is involved in regulation by S-AdoMet. CBS domain pairs from AMPK bind AMP or ATP. The CBS domains from IMPDH and the chloride channel CLC2 bind ATP.</td>

CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>cd04631 CBS pair domains found in archeal 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase gamma subunit-like proteins. Archeal gamma-subunit of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contains four CBS domains in tandem repeats, similar to eukaryotic homologs. AMPK is an important regulator of metabolism and of energy homeostasis. It is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic serine/threonine kinase subunit (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta and gamma). The gamma subunit senses the intracellular energy status by competitively binding AMP and ATP and is believed to be responsible for allosteric regulation of the whole complex. In humans mutations in gamma- subunit of AMPK are associated with hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and glycogen storage in the skeletal muscle.
