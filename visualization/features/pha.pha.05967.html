            <td id=al>These ferredoxin reductases are related to the NADPH cytochrome p450 reductases (CYPOR), but lack the FAD-binding region connecting sub-domain. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) is an FAD-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible electron transfer between NADP(H) and electron carrier proteins, such as ferredoxin and flavodoxin. Isoforms of these flavoproteins (i.e. having a non-covalently bound FAD as a prosthetic group) are present in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria in which they participate in a wide variety of redox metabolic pathways. The C-terminal domain contains most of the NADP(H) binding residues and the N-terminal domain interacts non-covalently with the isoalloxazine rings of the flavin molecule which lies largely in a large gap between the two domains. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase first accepts one electron from reduced ferredoxin to form a flavin semiquinone intermediate. The enzyme then accepts a second electron to form FADH2, which then transfers two electrons and a proton to NADP+ to form NADPH. CYPOR serves as an electron donor in several oxygenase systems and is a component of nitric oxide synthases, sulfite reducatase, and methionine synthase reductases. CYPOR transfers two electrons from NADPH to the heme of cytochrome p450 via FAD and FMN.  CYPOR has a C-terminal FNR-like FAD and NAD binding module, an FMN-binding domain, and an additional connecting  domain (inserted within the FAD binding region) that orients the FNR and FMN -binding domains. The C-terminal domain contains most of the NADP(H) binding residues, and the N-terminal domain interacts non-covalently with the isoalloxazine rings of the flavin molecule, which lies largely in a large gap betweed the two domains.

            <td id=al>Ferredoxin reductase (FNR), an FAD and NAD(P) binding protein, was intially identified as a chloroplast reductase activity, catalyzing the electron transfer from reduced iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin to NADP+ as the final step in the electron transport mechanism of photosystem I. FNR transfers electrons from reduced ferredoxin to FAD (forming FADH2 via a semiquinone intermediate) and then transfers a hydride ion to convert NADP+ to NADPH. FNR has since been shown to utilize a variety of electron acceptors and donors and has a variety of physiological functions including nitrogen assimilation, dinitrogen fixation, steroid hydroxylation, fatty acid metabolism, oxygenase activity, and methane assimilation in many organisms. FNR has an NAD(P)-binding sub-domain of the alpha/beta class and a discrete (usually N-terminal) flavin sub-domain which vary in orientation with respect to the NAD(P) binding domain. The N-terminal moeity may contain a flavin prosthetic group (as in flavoenzymes) or use flavin as a substrate. Because flavins such as FAD can exist in oxidized, semiquinone (one- electron reduced), or fully reduced hydroquinone forms, FNR can interact with one and 2 electron carriers. FNR has a strong preference for NADP(H) vs NAD(H).</td>

In MSR, electrons are transferred from NADPH to FAD to FMN to cob(II)alamin. MSR resembles proteins of the cytochrome p450 family including nitric oxide synthase, the alpha subunit of sulfite reductase, but contains an extended hinge region. NADPH cytochrome p450 reductase (CYPOR) serves as an electron donor in several oxygenase systems and is a component of nitric oxide synthases and methionine synthase reductases. CYPOR transfers two electrons from NADPH to the heme of cytochrome p450 via FAD and FMN.

NOS differs from CYPOR in a requirement for the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin and unlike most CYPOR is dimeric. Nitric oxide synthase produces nitric oxide in the conversion of L-arginine to L-citruline. NOS has been implicated in a variety of processes including cytotoxicity, anti-inflamation, neurotransmission, and vascular smooth muscle relaxation.</td>

The NADH-binding moiety interacts with part of the FAD and resembles a Rossmann fold. However, NAD is bound differently than in canonical Rossmann fold proteins. Nitrate reductases, flavoproteins similar to pyridine nucleotide cytochrome reductases, catalyze the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. The enzyme can be divided into three functional fragments that bind the cofactors molybdopterin, heme-iron, and FAD/NADH.</td>

            <td id=al>Cytochrome p450- like alpha subunits of E. coli sulfite reductase (SiR) multimerize with beta subunits to catalyze the NADPH dependent reduction of sulfite to sulfide. Beta subunits have an Fe4S4 cluster and a siroheme, while the alpha subunits (cysJ gene) are of the cytochrome p450 (CyPor) family having FAD and FMN as prosthetic groups and utilizing NADPH. Cypor (including cyt -450 reductase, nitric oxide synthase, and methionine synthase reductase) are ferredoxin reductase (FNR)-like proteins with an additional N-terminal  FMN domain and a connecting sub-domain inserted within the flavin binding portion of the FNR-like domain. The connecting domain orients the N-terminal FMN domain with the C-terminal FNR domain. NADPH cytochrome p450 reductase (CYPOR) serves as an electron donor in several oxygenase systems and is a component of nitric oxide synthases and methionine synthase reductases. CYPOR transfers two electrons from NADPH to the heme of cytochrome p450 via FAD and FMN. Ferredoxin-NADP+ (oxido)reductase is an FAD-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible electron transfer between NADP(H) and electron carrier proteins such as ferredoxin and flavodoxin. Isoforms of these flavoproteins (i.e. having a non-covalently bound FAD as a prosthetic group) are present in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria in which they participate in a wide variety of redox metabolic pathways. The C-terminal domain contains most of the NADP(H) binding residues, and the N-terminal domain interacts non-covalently with the isoalloxazine rings of the flavin molecule, which lies largely in a large gap betweed the two domains.

The NAD(P) binding domain of ferredoxin reductase-like proteins catalyze electron transfer between an NAD(P)-binding domain of the alpha/beta class and a discrete (usually N-terminal) domain which vary in orientation with respect to the NAD(P) binding domain.
