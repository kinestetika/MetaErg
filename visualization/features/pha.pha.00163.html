            <td id=al>Glutaredoxin, GrxC family. Glutaredoxins are thioltransferases (disulfide reductases) which utilize glutathione and NADPH as cofactors. Oxidized glutathione is regenerated by glutathione reductase. Together these components compose the glutathione system. Glutaredoxins utilize the CXXC motif common to thioredoxins and are involved in multiple cellular processes including protection from redox stress, reduction of critical enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase and the generation of reduced sulfur for iron sulfur cluster formation. Glutaredoxins are capable of reduction of mixed disulfides of glutathione as well as the formation of glutathione mixed disulfides. This family of glutaredoxins includes the E. coli protein GrxC (Grx3) which appears to have a secondary role in reducing ribonucleotide reductase (in the absence of GrxA) possibly indicating a role in the reduction of other protein disulfides.

GRX is a glutathione (GSH) dependent reductase, catalyzing the disulfide reduction of target proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase. It contains a redox active CXXC motif in a TRX fold and uses a similar dithiol mechanism employed by TRXs for intramolecular disulfide bond reduction of protein substrates. Unlike TRX, GRX has preference for mixed GSH disulfide substrates, in which it uses a monothiol mechanism where only the N-terminal cysteine is required. The flow of reducing equivalents in the GRX system goes from NADPH -> GSH reductase -> GSH -> GRX -> protein substrates. By altering the redox state of target proteins, GRX is involved in many cellular functions including DNA synthesis, signal transduction and the defense against oxidative stress.

            <td id=al>NrdH-redoxin (NrdH) family; NrdH is a small monomeric protein with a conserved redox active CXXC motif within a TRX fold, characterized by a glutaredoxin (GRX)-like sequence and TRX-like activity profile. In vitro, it displays protein disulfide reductase activity that is dependent on TRX reductase, not glutathione (GSH). It is part of the NrdHIEF operon, where NrdEF codes for class Ib ribonucleotide reductase (RNR-Ib), an efficient enzyme at low oxygen levels. Under these conditions when GSH is mostly conjugated to spermidine, NrdH can still function and act as a hydrogen donor for RNR-Ib. It has been suggested that the NrdHEF system may be the oldest RNR reducing system, capable of functioning in a microaerophilic environment, where GSH was not yet available. NrdH from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes can form domain-swapped dimers, although it is unknown if this happens in vivo. Domain-swapped dimerization, which results in the blocking of the TRX reductase binding site, could be a mechanism for regulating the oxidation state of the protein.</td>

            <td id=al>Glutaredoxin (GRX) family, PRX5 hybrid subfamily; composed of hybrid proteins containing peroxiredoxin (PRX) and GRX domains, which is found in some pathogenic bacteria and cyanobacteria. PRXs are thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins that confer a protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either thioredoxin, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF. GRX is a glutathione (GSH) dependent reductase, catalyzing the disulfide reduction of target proteins. PRX-GRX hybrid proteins from Haemophilus influenza and Neisseria meningitis exhibit GSH-dependent peroxidase activity. The flow of reducing equivalents in the catalytic cycle of the hybrid protein goes from NADPH -> GSH reductase -> GSH -> GRX domain of hybrid -> PRX domain of hybrid -> peroxide substrate.</td>
