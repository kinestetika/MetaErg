            <td id=al>sd00006 Tetratricopeptide repeat. The Tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) typically contains 34 amino acids and is found in a variety of organisms including bacteria, cyanobacteria, yeast, fungi, plants, and humans. It is present in a variety of proteins including those involved in chaperone, cell-cycle, transcription, and protein transport complexes. The number of TPR motifs varies among proteins. Those containing 5-6 tandem repeats generate a right-handed helical structure with an amphipathic channel that is thought to accommodate an alpha-helix of a target protein. It has been proposed that TPR proteins preferentially interact with WD-40 repeat proteins, but in many instances several TPR-proteins seem to aggregate to multi-protein complexes.</td>

This protein occurs in a species if and only if a transmembrane histidine kinase (TIGR02916) and a DNA-binding response regulator (TIGR02915) also occur. The present of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) suggests protein-protein interaction, possibly for the regulation of PEP-CTERM protein expression, since many PEP-CTERM proteins in these genomes are preceded by a proposed DNA binding site for the response regulator.</td>

Members of this family are MEROPS classification C39 family cysteine peptidases, a group that includes many processing enzyme for peptide natural products such as lantibiotics and other bacteriocins. This family, more specifically, includes PA2778 as found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All members of the defining seed alignment are encoded in the vicinity of a homolog of PA2779 (see HMM NF033919). Note that the C-terminal region consists largely of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), so classification using this HMM must be based on comparing the top domain score to the second gathering threshold (GA2).</td>
