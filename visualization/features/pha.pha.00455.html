            <td id=al>cd07402 Enterobacter aerogenes GpdQ and related proteins, metallophosphatase domain. GpdQ (glycerophosphodiesterase Q, also known as Rv0805 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis) is a binuclear metallophosphoesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of mono-, di-, and triester substrates, including some organophosphate pesticides and products of the degradation of nerve agents.  The GpdQ homolog, Rv0805, has 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity. GpdQ and Rv0805 belong to the metallophosphatase (MPP) superfamily.  MPPs are functionally diverse, but all share a conserved domain with an active site consisting of two metal ions (usually manganese, iron, or zinc) coordinated with octahedral geometry by a cage of histidine, aspartate, and asparagine residues. The MPP superfamily includes: Mre11/SbcD-like exonucleases, Dbr1-like RNA lariat debranching enzymes, YfcE-like phosphodiesterases, purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), YbbF-like UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolases, and acid sphingomyelinases (ASMases).  The conserved domain is a double beta-sheet sandwich with a di-metal active site made up of residues located at the C-terminal side of the sheets. This domain is thought to allow for productive metal coordination.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07385 Bacillus subtilis YkuE and related proteins, C-terminal metallophosphatase domain. YkuE is an uncharacterized Bacillus subtilis protein with a C-terminal metallophosphatase domain and an N-terminal twin-arginine (RR) motif. An RR-signal peptide derived from the Bacillus subtilis YkuE protein can direct Tat-dependent secretion of agarase in Streptomyces lividans. This is an indication that YkuE is transported by the Bacillus subtilis Tat (Twin-arginine translocation) pathway machinery.  YkuE belongs to the metallophosphatase (MPP) superfamily.  MPPs are functionally diverse, but all share a conserved domain with an active site consisting of two metal ions (usually manganese, iron, or zinc) coordinated with octahedral geometry by a cage of histidine, aspartate, and asparagine residues.

            <td id=al>cd00840 Mre11 nuclease, N-terminal metallophosphatase domain. Mre11 (also known as SbcD in Escherichia coli) is a subunit of the MRX protein complex. This complex includes: Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2/Nbs1, and plays a vital role in several nuclear processes including DNA double-strand break repair, telomere length maintenance, cell cycle checkpoint control, and meiotic recombination, in eukaryotes. During double-strand break repair, the MRX complex is required to hold the two ends of a broken chromosome together. In vitro studies show that Mre11 has 3'-5' exonuclease activity on dsDNA templates and endonuclease activity on dsDNA and ssDNA templates. In addition to the N-terminal phosphatase domain, the eukaryotic MRE11 members of this family have a C-terminal DNA binding domain (not included in this alignment model). MRE11-like proteins are found in prokaryotes and archaea was well as in eukaryotes. Mre11 belongs to the metallophosphatase (MPP) superfamily. MPPs are functionally diverse, but all share a conserved domain with an active site consisting of two metal ions (usually manganese, iron, or zinc) coordinated with octahedral geometry by a cage of histidine, aspartate, and asparagine residues. The MPP superfamily includes: Mre11/SbcD-like exonucleases, Dbr1-like RNA lariat debranching enzymes, YfcE-like phosphodiesterases, purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), YbbF-like UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolases, and acid sphingomyelinases (ASMases).
