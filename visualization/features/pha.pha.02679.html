            <td id=al>Oxalate:formate antiporter (OFA) and similar proteins of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. This subfamily is composed of Oxalobacter formigenes oxalate:formate antiporter (OFA or OxlT) and similar proteins. O. formigenes, a commensal found in the gut of animals and humans, plays an important role in clearing dietary oxalate from the intestinal tract, which is carried out by OFA/OxlT, an anion transporter that facilitates the exchange of divalent oxalate with monovalent formate, the product of oxalate decarboxylation. This exchange generates an electrochemical proton gradient and is the source of energy for ATP synthesis in this cell. The OFA-like subfamily belongs to the Monocarboxylate transporter -like (MCT-like) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins. MFS proteins are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

In many of these cassettes, two subunits are found rather than one, suggesting the antiporter is sometimes homodimeric, sometimes heterodimeric.</td>

MCT is also called Solute carrier family 16 (SLC16 or SLC16A). It is composed of 14 members, MCT1-14. MCTs play an integral role in cellular metabolism via lactate transport and have been implicated in metabolic synergy in tumors. MCTs have been found to facilitate the transport across the plasma membrane not only of monocarboxylates (MCT1-4), but also thyroid hormones (MCT8/10), and aromatic acids (MCT10). Yeast MCT homologous (Mch) proteins are not involved in the uptake of monocarboxylates; their substrates are not known. The MCT-like family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

The animal Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family is also called Solute carrier family 16 (SLC16 or SLC16A). It is composed of 14 members, MCT1-14. MCTs play an integral role in cellular metabolism via lactate transport and have been implicated in metabolic synergy in tumors. MCT1-4 are proton-coupled transporters that facilitate the transport across the plasma membrane of monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, branched-chain oxo acids derived from leucine, valine and isoleucine, and ketone bodies such as acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetate. MCT8 and MCT10 are transporters which stimulate the cellular uptake of thyroid hormones such as thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and diidothyronine (T2). MCT10 also functions as a sodium-independent transporter that mediates the uptake or efflux of aromatic acids. Many members are orphan transporters whose substrates are yet to be determined. The MCT family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>Major Facilitator Superfamily. The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) is a large and diverse group of secondary transporters that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. MFS proteins facilitate the transport across cytoplasmic or internal membranes of a variety of substrates including ions, sugar phosphates, drugs, neurotransmitters, nucleosides, amino acids, and peptides. They do so using the electrochemical potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins have medical significance in humans such as the glucose transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen storage disease when mutated.</td>

This family is composed of eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family transporters and related bacterial multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters including several proteins from Escherichia coli such as multidrug resistance protein MdtG, from Bacillus subtilis such as multidrug resistance proteins 1 (Bmr1) and 2 (Bmr2), and from Staphylococcus aureus such as quinolone resistance protein NorA. The family also includes Escherichia coli arabinose efflux transporters YfcJ and YhhS. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. The SLC18 transporter family includes vesicular monoamine transporters (VAT1 and VAT2), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and SLC18B1, which is proposed to be a vesicular polyamine transporter (VPAT). The MdtG/SLC18 family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

It is widely expressed in many tissues its main function is to transport lactate into the cell. MCT1 deficiency has been identified as a cause of profound ketoacidosis, a potentially lethal condition caused by the imbalance between hepatic production and extrahepatic utilization of ketone bodies.

            <td id=al>Purine ribonucleoside efflux pump NepI and similar transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily. This family is composed of purine efflux pumps such as Escherichia coli NepI and Bacillus subtilis PbuE, sugar efflux transporters such as Corynebacterium glutamicum arabinose efflux permease, multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters such as Streptomyces lividans chloramphenicol resistance protein (CmlR), and similar proteins. NepI and PbuE are involved in the efflux of purine ribonucleosides such as guanosine, adenosine and inosine, as well as purine bases like guanine, adenine, and hypoxanthine, and purine base analogs. They play a role in the maintenance of cellular purine base pools, as well as in protecting the cells and conferring resistance against toxic purine base analogs such as 6-mercaptopurine. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. The NepI-like family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>Monocarboxylate transporters 9 and 14, and similar proteins of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. Monocarboxylate transporters 3 (MCT3) and 4 (MCT4) are also called Solute carrier family 16 members 8 (SLC16A8) and 3 (SLC16A3), respectively. They are proton-coupled transporters that facilitate the transport across the plasma membrane of monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, branched-chain oxo acids derived from leucine, valine and isoleucine, and ketone bodies such as acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetate. MCT3 is preferentially expressed in the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium and plays a role in pH and ion homeostasis of the outer retina by facilitating the transport of lactate and H(+) out of the retina. Mice deficient with MCT3 display altered visual function. MCT4 is highly expressed in tissues dependent on glycolysis, and it plays an important role in lactate efflux from cells. MCT4 is expressed in neurons and astrocytes; it has been found to play a role in neuroprotective mechanism of ischemic preconditioning in animals (in the gerbil) with transient cerebral ischemia. Increased MCT4 expression has also been correlated with worse prognosis across many cancer types. MCT3/4 belongs to the Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins. MFS proteins are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>
