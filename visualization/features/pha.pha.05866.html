            <td id=al>Type III Pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-Dependent Enzymes, YBL036c-like proteins. This family contains mostly uncharacterized proteins, widely distributed among eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea, that bear similarity to the yeast hypothetical protein YBL036c, which is homologous to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene that is co-transcribed with a known proline biosynthetic gene. YBL036c is a single domain monomeric protein with a typical TIM barrel fold. It binds the PLP cofactor and has been shown to exhibit amino acid racemase activity. The YBL036c structure is similar to the N-terminal domain of the fold type III PLP-dependent enzymes, bacterial alanine racemase and eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase, which are two-domain dimeric proteins. The lack of a second domain in YBL036c may explain limited D- to L-alanine racemase or non-specific racemase activity.</td>

This subfamily contains mainly uncharacterized proteobacterial proteins with similarity to the hypothetical Escherichia coli protein YggS, a homolog of yeast YBL036c, which is homologous to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene that is co-transcribed with a known proline biosynthetic gene. Like yeast YBL036c, Yggs is a single domain monomeric protein with a typical TIM-barrel fold. Its structure, which shows a covalently-bound PLP cofactor, is similar to the N-terminal domain of the fold type III PLP-dependent enzymes, bacterial alanine racemase and eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase, which are two-domain dimeric proteins. YggS has not been characterized extensively and its biological function is still unkonwn.</td>

            <td id=al>Type III Pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-Dependent Enzymes. The fold type III PLP-dependent enzyme family is predominantly composed of two-domain proteins with similarity to bacterial alanine racemases (AR) including eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylases (ODC), prokaryotic diaminopimelate decarboxylases (DapDC), biosynthetic arginine decarboxylases (ADC), carboxynorspermidine decarboxylases (CANSDC), and similar proteins. AR-like proteins contain an N-terminal PLP-binding TIM-barrel domain and a C-terminal beta-sandwich domain. They exist as homodimers with active sites that lie at the interface between the TIM barrel domain of one subunit and the beta-sandwich domain of the other subunit. These proteins play important roles in the biosynthesis of amino acids and polyamine. The family also includes the single-domain YBL036c-like proteins, which contain a single PLP-binding TIM-barrel domain without any N- or C-terminal extensions. Due to the lack of a second domain, these proteins may possess only limited D- to L-alanine racemase activity or non-specific racemase activity.</td>
