This family includes dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases such as methyltetrahydrofolate, corrinoid iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase (MeTr) and methionine synthase (MetH).  DHPS, a functional homodimer, catalyzes the condensation of p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) in the de novo biosynthesis of folate, which is an essential cofactor in both nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis. Prokaryotes (and some lower eukaryotes) must synthesize folate de novo, while higher eukaryotes are able to utilize dietary folate and therefore lack DHPS.  Sulfonamide drugs, which are substrate analogs of pABA, target DHPS.  Cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group via a methyl- cob(III)amide intermediate.  These include MeTr, a functional heterodimer, and the folate binding domain of MetH.</td>

Three of the four cognate enzymes (trimethylamine, dimethylamine, and monomethylamine methyltransferases) all have the unusual, ribosomally incorporated amino acid pyrrolysine at the active site. All act in systems in which a methyl group is transferred to the corrinoid protein to create methylcobalamin, from which the methyl group is later transferred elsewhere.</td>

            <td id=al>B12 binding domain. Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase is a large modular protein that catalyses methyl transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) to homocysteine. During the catalytic cycle, it supports three distinct methyl transfer reactions, each involving the cobalamin (vitamin B12) cofactor and a substrate bound to its own functional unit. The cobalamin cofactor plays an essential role in this reaction, accepting the methyl group from CH3-H4folate to form methylcob(III)alamin, and in turn donating the methyl group to homocysteine to generate methionine and cob(I)alamin. Methionine synthase is a large enzyme composed of four structurally and functionally distinct modules: the first two modules bind homocysteine and CH3-H4folate, the third module binds the cobalamin cofactor and the C-terminal module binds S-adenosylmethionine. The cobalamin-binding module is composed of two structurally distinct domains: a 4-helical bundle cap domain (residues 651-740 in the Escherichia coli enzyme) and an alpha/beta B12-binding domain (residues 741-896). The 4-helical bundle forms a cap over the alpha/beta domain, which acts to shield the methyl ligand of cobalamin from solvent. Furthermore, in the conversion to the active conformation of this enzyme, the 4-helical cap rotates to allow the cobalamin cofactor to bind the activation domain. The alpha/beta domain is a common cobalamin-binding motif, whereas the 4-helical bundle domain with its methyl cap is a distinctive feature of methionine synthases.</td>
