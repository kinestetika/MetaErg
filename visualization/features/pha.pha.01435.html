FtsZ is capable of polymerizing in a GTP-driven process into structures similar to those formed by tubulin. FtsZ forms a ring-shaped septum at the site of bacterial cell division, which is required for constriction of cell membrane and cell envelope to yield two daughter cells.</td>

            <td id=al>Subfamily of FitZ and Cell-structure-related euryarchaeota tubulin/FtsZ homolog-like. FtsZ is a GTPase that is similar to the eukaryotic tubulins and is essential for cell division in prokaryotes.  CetZ-like proteins are related to tubulin and FtsZ and co-exists with FtsZ in many archaea. However, a recent study found that Cetz proteins (formerly annotated FtsZ type 2) are not required for cell division. Instead, CetZ proteins are shown to be involved in controlling archaeal cell shape dynamics.  The results from inactivation studies of CetZ proteins in Haloferax volcanii suggest that CetZ1 is essential for normal swimming motility and rod-cell development.</td>

FtsZ and tubulin are GTPases, this entry is the GTPase domain. FtsZ can polymerise into tubes, sheets, and rings in vitro and is ubiquitous in bacteria and archaea.</td>

            <td id=al>Tubulin protein family of FtsZ and CetZ-like. This family includes tubulin alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon, and zeta-tubulins as well as FtsZ and CetZ, all of which are involved in polymer formation. Tubulin is the major component of microtubules, but also exists as a heterodimer and as a curved oligomer. Microtubules exist in all eukaryotic cells and are responsible for many functions, including cellular transport, cell motility, and mitosis.  FtsZ forms a ring-shaped septum at the site of bacterial cell division, which is required for constriction of cell membrane and cell envelope to yield two daughter cells. FtsZ can polymerize into tubes, sheets, and rings in vitro and is ubiquitous in eubacteria, archaea, and chloroplasts.
