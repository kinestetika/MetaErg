            <td id=al>cd19588 serpin miropin and similar proteins. Miropin, the serpin from Tannerella forsythia, is thought to contribute to the virulence of periodontal pathogens by inhibiting neutrophil serine proteases. Miropin broadly inhibits serine endopeptidases (SEPs) including trypsin, neutrophil elastase, pancreatic elastase, subtilisin, and cathepsin G and cysteine endopeptidases (CEPs) including papain, calpain-like peptidase Tpr, and gingipain K through various reactive-site bonds. This is achieved by offering several target bonds of the RCL for cleavage within a bait region, instead of a single RSB as found in canonical serpins. In addition, promiscuous inhibition is facilitated by the capacity to insert strands deviating from the canonical length into the central sheet A, while keeping the prey peptidase bound and inactivated. The structural adaptation of miropin to provide a relaxed inhibitory specificity, which allows for formation of inhibitory complexes using different sites, is unique among serpins. SERine Proteinase INhibitors (serpins) exhibit conformational polymorphism shifting from native to cleaved, latent, delta, or polymorphic forms. Many serpins, such as antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin, function as serine protease inhibitors which regulate blood coagulation cascades. Non-inhibitory serpins perform many diverse functions such as chaperoning proteins or transporting hormones. Serpins are of medical interest because mutants have been associated with blood clotting disorders, emphysema, cirrhosis, and dementia. A classification based on evolutionary relatedness has resulted in the assignment of serpins to 16 clades designated A-P along with some orphans.</td>

            <td id=al>cd19590 serpin thermopin and similar proteins. Thermopin, the serpin from Thermobifida fusca, functions as an irreversible proteinase inhibitor with resistance to polymerization at high temperatures. The crystal structure of the cleaved thermopin was found to adopt the canonical serpin fold, supporting its inclusion as a classical inhibitory member of the serpin superfamily. A detailed structural comparison revealed unique features, including charge-stabilizing interactions, a deleted element of secondary structure (the G helix), and a C-terminal "tail" that interacts with the top of the A beta sheet and plays an important role in the folding/unfolding of the molecule. These unique features provide structural and biophysical evidence as to how this unusual serpin member has adapted to remain functional in an extreme environment. SERine Proteinase INhibitors (serpins) exhibit conformational polymorphism shifting from native to cleaved, latent, delta, or polymorphic forms.

            <td id=al>cd19577 serpin family J, Ixodes ricinus serpin-2 (IRS-2). The serpin family J clade contains serpins from the Chelicerates. This model includes serpins from the Japanese horseshoe crab, mites, ticks, and spiders. The Limulus intracellular coagulation inhibitor, designated LICI, was isolated from hemocytes of the Japanese horseshoe crab. It blocks the amidolytic activities of Limulus lipopolysaccharide-sensitive serine protease, factor C and also inhibits human alpha-thrombin, rat salivary kallikrein, bovine plasmin, and trypsin but not Limulus clotting enzyme, Limulus factor B, bovine factor Xa, human factor XIa, human tissue plasminogen activator, human urokinase, chymotrypsin, elastase, and papain. Glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate had no effect on the inhibitory activity. The castor bean tick, Ixodes ricinus serpin-2 (IRS-2) whose structure has been solved, unlike that of the LICI, is found in the saliva of the tick and primarily targets 2 proinflammatory serine proteases: cathepsin G and mast cell chymase, and in higher molar excess, thrombin. It also blocks cathepsin G- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Thus it has a dual role and can interfere with both inflammation and wound healing during tick feeding.

            <td id=al>cd02051 serpin family E member 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1/PLANH1, also called endothelial PAI) is the primary, fast-acting inhibitor of plasminogen activators. It is often bound to vitronectin, an abundant component of the extracellular matrix in many tissues. PAI1 deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder that causes excessive or prolonged bleeding due to blood clots being broken down too early. PAI-1 is a member of the serpin superfamily and belongs to clade E.

            <td id=al>cd19576 serpin family I member 2, pancpin. Pancpin (also called proteinase inhibitor 14/PI14 or myoepithelium-derived serine protease inhibitor/MEPI ) is an inhibitory member of the serpin superfamily. It is downregulated in pancreatic and breast cancer, and is associated with acinar cell apoptosis and pancreatic insufficiency when absent in mice. Pancpin was found to inhibit pancreatic chymotrypsin and elastase. It is thought that pancpin protects pancreatic cells from the consequences of premature activation of their respective zymogens. This subgroup belongs to clade I of the serpin superfamily.

            <td id=al>cd19601 serpins similar to Drosophila melanogaster Serpin 42Da. This subfamily is composed mainly of insect serpins, including Drosophila melanogaster serpin 42Da. Serpins in insects function within development, wound healing and immunity. Serpin 42Da, previously serpin 4, is a serine protease inhibitor that is capable of remarkable functional diversity through the alternative splicing of four different reactive center loop exons. Insect serpins from stink bug, alfalfa leafcutting bee, red flour beetle, house fly, and brown planthopper are also included in this subfamily.

It is instead expressed by multiple cell types and is located on the surface of these cells, bound to glycosaminoglycans. GDN plays a role in thrombosis and atherosclerosis and is a clade E serpin. In general, SERine Proteinase INhibitors (serpins) exhibit conformational polymorphism shifting from native to cleaved, latent, delta, or polymorphic forms. Many serpins, such as antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin, function as serine protease inhibitors which regulate blood coagulation cascades. Non-inhibitory serpins perform many diverse functions such as chaperoning proteins or transporting hormones. Serpins are of medical interest because mutants have been associated with blood clotting disorders, emphysema, cirrhosis, and dementia. A classification based on evolutionary relatedness has resulted in the assignment of serpins to 16 clades designated A-P along with some orphans.</td>

This group contains proteins similar to alpha-1-antitrypsin (also called A1AT, A1A, AAT, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor/A1PI, alpha1-antiproteinase/A1AP, and serum trypsin inhibitor), a protease inhibitor that belongs to the serpin superfamily. It is encoded in humans by the SERPINA1 gene. When the blood contains inadequate amounts of A1AT or functionally defective A1AT (such as in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), neutrophil elastase is excessively free to break down elastin, degrading the elasticity of the lungs, which results in respiratory complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Normally, A1AT leaves its site of origin, the liver, and joins the systemic circulation; defective A1AT can fail to do so, building up in the liver, which results in cirrhosis. This group belongs to the clade A of the serpin superfamily, which includes the classical serine proteinase inhibitors, alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, protein C inhibitor, kallistatin, and non-inhibitory serpins, like corticosteroid and thyroxin binding globulins.

Squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1, also called HsT1196 or protein T4-A) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2 (SCCA2, also called PI11 or leupin), which are encoded by the SERPINB3 and SERPINB4 genes, respectively, are members of the serpin family of serine protease inhibitors. SCCA1 is a so called cross-class serpin, inhibiting cysteine proteinases such as cathepsin S, K, L, and papain. SCCA2 inhibits chymotrypsin-like serine proteases including chymase, cathepsin G, and Der p1. Elevated levels of SCCA1 and SCCA2 have been detected in chronic inflammatory conditions involving the skin, especially atopic dermatitis (AD)and psoriasis, as well as in respiratory inflammatory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tuberculosis. They are both normally co-expressed in squamous epithelial cells of tongue, esophagus, tonsils, epidermal hair follicles, lung and uterus, and become highly up-regulated in squamous carcinomas of these organs. Diseases associated with SERPINB3 include anal cancer and cervical squamous cell carcinoma, whereas SERPINB4 include squamous cell carcinoma and chromosome 18Q deletion syndrome. The ovalbumin family of serpins (ov-serpins) is a family of closely related proteins, whose members can be secreted (ovalbumin), cytosolic (leukocyte elastase inhibitor, LEI), or targeted to both compartments (plasminogen activator inhibitor 2, PAI-2).

            <td id=al>cd02043 serpin family P, plant serpins. Plant SERine Proteinase INhibitors (serpins) are potent inhibitors of a range of mammalian serine proteases in vitro, and at least seven serpin genes are expressed in Arabidopsis. Serpins from plants display a wide range of functions including protection of storage protein degradation by exogenous proteases and seed survival within the herbivore digestive tract. Comparison between Arabidopsis AtSerpin1 and other serpins reveals several distinguishing features including a plant-specific insertion between s2B and s3B, with a plant-specific motif YXXGXDXRXF and the presence of a beta-bulge in strand s2C. The conserved Asp-230 and Arg-232 in the motif form a network of hydrogen bonds stabilize a loop region, which is otherwise disordered in many other serpin structures. AtSerpin1 is targeted to the secretory pathway and was shown to interact with cysteine protease RD21 (RESPONSIVE TO DESICCATION-21). RD21 accepts peptides and ligates them to the N termini of acceptor proteins so it has been proposed that AtSerpin1 functions to curb this activity.

Less is known of Brugia malayi SPN-1, which is present at all stages of the parasite life cycle and could exist to inhibit a cognate proteinase endogenous to the parasite. Schistosoma serpins are hypothesized to play a role in both the physiological control of elastase within the schistosomes, and protection of the parasite from activated neutrophils during inflammation.

Human SERPINB1 is a potent intracellular inhibitor for granzyme H (GzmH) which is constitutively expressed in NK cells and induces target cell death. GzmH cleaves SERPINB1 at Phe343 in the RCL to mediate suicide inhibition. Equine leukocyte elastase inhibitor (HLEI) in contrast to other serpins contains no carbohydrate and has a blocked amino terminus. HLEI is a thymosin beta4-binding protein suggesting a physiological role for cytoplasmic elastase inhibitors in the thymosin B4-regulated rearrangement of the cytoskeleton of leukocytes.

Alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (a1AC/A1AC/a1ACT/AACT) is an alpha globulin glycoprotein that is a member of the serpin superfamily. In humans, it is encoded by the SERPINA3 gene. It inhibits the activity of proteases, such as cathepsin G that is found in neutrophils, and chymases found in mast cells, by cleaving them into a different shape or conformation. This activity protects some tissues, such as the lower respiratory tract, from damage caused by proteolytic enzymes. Deficiency of this protein has been associated with liver disease.

Alpha2-antiplasmin inhibitor (A2AP/API, also called plasmin inhibitor/PLI or alpha-2-antiplasmin) is the primary inhibitor of plasmin, a proteinase that digests fibrin, the main component of blood clots. Alpha2AP forms an inactive 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasmin. It also rapidly crosslinks to fibrin during blood clotting by activated coagulation factor XIII, and as a consequence fibrin becomes more resistant to fibrinolysis. Therefore alpha2AP is important in modulating the effectiveness and persistence of fibrin with respect to its susceptibility to digestion and removal by plasmin.

HCII is allosterically activated by binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The specificity of HCII for thrombin is conferred by a highly acidic hirudin-like N-terminal tail, which becomes available after GAG binding for interaction with the anion-binding exosite I of thrombin. HCII deficiency can lead to increased thrombin generation and a hypercoagulable state. This subgroup corresponds to clade D of the serpin superfamily.

Bomapin (also called proteinase inhibitor 10/PI10) is a hematopoietic- and myeloid leukaemia-specific protease inhibitor which is thought to augment proliferation or apoptosis of leukemia cells, depending on growth factor availability. Bomapin is expressed only in bone marrow, leukocytes of patients with myeloid leukaemia that correspond to myeloid progenitors, and promyelocytic leukaemia cell lines (HL60, THP1, and AML-193), but it is not present in terminally differentiated leukocytes. The ovalbumin family of serpins (ov-serpins) is a family of closely related proteins, whose members can be secreted (ovalbumin), cytosolic (leukocyte elastase inhibitor, LEI), or targeted to both compartments (plasminogen activator inhibitor 2, PAI-2). It also characterized by N- and C-terminal extensions, the absence of a signal peptide, and a Ser rather than an Asn residue at the penultimate position. The ov-serpins corresponds to clade B of the serpin superfamily.

Kallistatin (KST, also called proteinase inhibitor 4/PI4, or kallikrein inhibitor/KAL) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SERPINA4 gene. Kallistatin inhibits human amidolytic and kininogenase activities of tissue kallikrein. Heparin blocks kallistatin's complex formation with tissue kallikrein and abolishes its inhibitory effect on tissue kallikrein's activity. Kallistatin was found to be expressed in human liver, stomach, pancreas, kidney, aorta, testes, prostate, artery, atrium, ventricle, lung, renal proximal tubular cell, and a colonic carcinoma cell line T84.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (also called A1AT, A1A, AAT, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor/A1PI, alpha1-antiproteinase/A1AP, proteinase inhibitor/PI, and serum trypsin inhibitor) is a protease inhibitor that belongs to the serpin superfamily. It is encoded in humans by the SERPINA1 gene. When the blood contains inadequate amounts of A1AT or functionally defective A1AT (such as in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), neutrophil elastase is excessively free to break down elastin, degrading the elasticity of the lungs, which results in respiratory complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Normally, A1AT leaves its site of origin, the liver, and joins the systemic circulation; defective A1AT fails to do so, building up in the liver, which results in cirrhosis. This family contains other A1AT-like members of clade A of the serpin superfamily.

Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG, also called T4-binding globulin) is a globulin that binds thyroid hormones in circulation. It is one of three transport proteins (along with transthyretin and serum albumin) responsible for carrying the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the bloodstream. TBG is synthesized primarily in the liver and is a serpin with no inhibitory function like many other members of this class of proteins. There are two forms of inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency: the complete form (TBG-CD), which results in a total loss of thyroxine-binding globulin, and the partial form (TBG-PD), which reduces the amount of this protein or alters its structure. Neither of these conditions causes any problems with thyroid function, but it can be mistaken for more serious thyroid disorders, such as hypothyroidism.

Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains in addition to its serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose.[21] It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases.

The clade A of the serpin superfamily includes the classical serine proteinase inhibitors, alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, protein C inhibitor, kallistatin, and non-inhibitory serpins, like corticosteroid and thyroxin binding globulins. In general, SERine Proteinase INhibitors (serpins) exhibit conformational polymorphism shifting from native to cleaved, latent, delta, or polymorphic forms. Many serpins, such as antitrypsin and antichymotrypsin, function as serine protease inhibitors which regulate blood coagulation cascades. Non-inhibitory serpins perform many diverse functions such as chaperoning proteins or transporting hormones. Serpins are of medical interest because mutants have been associated with blood clotting disorders, emphysema, cirrhosis, and dementia. A classification based on evolutionary relatedness has resulted in the assignment of serpins to 16 clades designated A-P along with some orphans.</td>

            <td id=al>cd19559 serpin family A member 14, uterine milk protein and uteroferrin-associated basic protein 2. The uteroferrin(Uf)-associated basic proteins-2(UABP-2/UABP/UfAP) are a group of three (Mr = 42K, 48K, and 50K) antigenically related, basic glycoproteins secreted by the porcine uterus under the influence of progesterone (P4), which exist as heterodimers (Mr = 80,000) with the iron-binding acid phosphatase, Uf. This group also contains UTMP (uterine milk protein), encoded by SERPINA14. UTMP binds noncovalently to the iron-containing glycoprotein uteroferrin, which displays phosphatase activity and is thought to be involved with iron transport to the fetus. Synthesis of these serpins is induced by progesterone in the uterus. UTMP is also an activin-binding protein and has been implicated in regulation of uterine immune function.

            <td id=al>cd19584 serpin family O, viral serpin-3. This group of viral serpins are from the Orthopoxvirus branch (cowpox, ectromelia, vaccinia, variola, and rabbitpox) and corresponding to clade O which contains the viral serpin-3 (SPI-3-like) serpins. The other is clade N which contains viral serpin-1 (SPI-1-like) and viral serpin-2 (SPI-2-like) serpins. SPI-3 is an N-glycosylated bifunctional protein that acts as both a proteinase inhibitor and a suppressor of infected cell-cell fusion.
