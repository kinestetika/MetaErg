            <td id=al>Solute carrier family 45 and similar sugar transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. This group includes the solute carrier 45 (SLC45) family as well as plant sucrose transporters (SUCs or SUTs) and similar proteins such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe general alpha-glucoside permease. the SLC45 family is composed of four (A1-A4) vertebrate proteins as well as related insect proteins such as Drosophila sucrose transporter SCRT or Slc45-1. Members of this group transport sucrose and other sugars like maltose into the cell, with the concomitant uptake of protons (symport system). Plant sucrose transporters are crucial to carbon partitioning, playing a key role in phloem loading/unloading. They play a key role in loading and unloading of sucrose into the phloem and as a result, they control sucrose distribution throughout the whole plant and drive the osmotic flow system in the phloem. They also play a role in the exchange of sucrose between beneficial symbionts (mycorrhiza and Rhizobium) as well as pathogens such as nematodes and parasitic fungi. There are nine sucrose transporter genes in Arabidopsis and five in rice. Vertebrate SLC45 family proteins have been implicated in the regulation of glucose homoeostasis in the brain (SLC45A1), with skin and hair pigmentation (SLC45A2), and with prostate cancer and myelination (SLC45A3). Mutations in SLC45A2, also called MATP (membrane-associated transporter protein) or melanoma antigen AIM1, cause oculocutaneous albinism type 4 (OCA4), an autosomal recessive disorder of melanin biosynthesis that results in congenital hypopigmentation of ocular and cutaneous tissues. The SLC45 family and related sugar transporters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to  function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>GPH family sucrose/H+ symporter. This model represents sucrose/proton symporters, found in plants, from the Glycoside-Pentoside-Hexuronide (GPH)/cation symporter family. These proteins are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains. Members may export sucrose (e.g. SUT1, SUT4) from green parts to the phloem for long-distance transport or import sucrose (e.g SUT2) to sucrose sinks such as the tap root of the carrot.</td>

            <td id=al>bacterial MdtG-like and eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. This family is composed of eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family transporters and related bacterial multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters including several proteins from Escherichia coli such as multidrug resistance protein MdtG, from Bacillus subtilis such as multidrug resistance proteins 1 (Bmr1) and 2 (Bmr2), and from Staphylococcus aureus such as quinolone resistance protein NorA. The family also includes Escherichia coli arabinose efflux transporters YfcJ and YhhS. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. The SLC18 transporter family includes vesicular monoamine transporters (VAT1 and VAT2), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and SLC18B1, which is proposed to be a vesicular polyamine transporter (VPAT). The MdtG/SLC18 family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>Major Facilitator Superfamily. The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) is a large and diverse group of secondary transporters that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. MFS proteins facilitate the transport across cytoplasmic or internal membranes of a variety of substrates including ions, sugar phosphates, drugs, neurotransmitters, nucleosides, amino acids, and peptides. They do so using the electrochemical potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins have medical significance in humans such as the glucose transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen storage disease when mutated.</td>

This subfamily is composed of Escherichia coli membrane proteins, YfcJ and YhhS, Bacillus subtilis uncharacterized MFS-type transporter YwoG, and similar proteins. YfcJ and YhhS are putative arabinose efflux transporters. YhhS has been implicated glyphosate resistance. YfcJ-like arabinose efflux transporters belong to the bacterial MdtG-like and eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters. MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. MdtH confers resistance to norfloxacin and enoxacin. MdtH-like MDR transporters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>Salmonella enterica Na+/melibiose symporter MelB and similar transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily. This family is composed of Salmonella enterica Na+/melibiose symporter MelB, Major Facilitator Superfamily domain-containing proteins, MFSD2 and MFSD12, and other sugar transporters. MelB catalyzes the electrogenic symport of galactosides with Na+, Li+ or H+. The MFSD2 subfamily is composed of two vertebrate members, MFSD2A and MFSD2B. MFSD2A is more commonly called sodium-dependent lysophosphatidylcholine symporter 1 (NLS1). It is an LPC symporter that plays an essential role for blood-brain barrier formation and function. Inactivating mutations in MFSD2A cause a lethal microcephaly syndrome. MFSD2B is a potential risk or protect factor in the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. MelB-like family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>
