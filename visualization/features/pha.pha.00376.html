            <td id=al>cd13543 Substrate binding domain of ferric iron transporter, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold superfamily. The periplasmic iron binding protein plays an essential role in the iron uptake pathway of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria from the Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae families and is critical for survival of these pathogens within the host. This periplasmic protein (Fbp) has high affinities for ferric iron and serves as the primary receptor for transport. After binding iron with high affinity, Fbp interacts with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. The ferric iron-binding proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge. They have been shown to bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>

The periplasmic iron binding protein plays an essential role in the iron uptake pathway of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria from the Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae families and is critical for survival of these pathogens within the host. On the other hand, thiamin is an essential cofactor in all living systems. Thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes play an important role in carbohydrate and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Most prokaryotes, plants, and fungi can synthesize thiamin, but it is not synthesized in vertebrates. These periplasmic domains have high affinities for their respective substrates and serve as the primary receptor for transport. After binding iron and thiamine with high affinity, they interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase.

This group represents the periplasmic binding domain that serves as the primary high-affinity receptor of an uncharacterized ABC-type polyamine transporter from Rhodopseudomonas palustris Cga009 and related proteins from other bacteria. Polyamine transport plays an essential role in the regulation of intracellular polyamine levels which are known to be elevated in rapidly proliferating cells and tumors. Natural polyamines are putrescine, spermindine, and spermine. They are polycations that play multiple roles in cell growth, survival and proliferation, and plant stress and disease resistance. They can interact with negatively charged molecules, such as nucleic acids, to modulate their functions. Members of this family belong to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold superfamily.

            <td id=al>cd13545 Substrate binding domain of thiamin transporter, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold superfamily. Thiamin-binding protein TbpA is the periplasmic component of ABC-type transporter in E. coli, while the transmembrane permease and ATPase are ThiP and ThiQ, respectively. Thiamin (vitamin B1) is an essential confactor in all living systems that  most prokaryotes, plants, and fungi can synthesized thiamin. However,  in vertebrates, thiamine cannot be synthesized and must therefore be obtained through dietary absorption.  In addition to thiamin biosynthesis, most organisms can import thiamin using specific transporters. After binding thiamine with high affinity, TbpA interacts with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. The thiamine-binding proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge.

            <td id=al>cd13551 Substrate binding domain of an uncharacterized ferric iron transporter, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold superfamily. The periplasmic iron binding protein plays an essential role in the iron uptake pathway of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria from the Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae families and is critical for survival of these pathogens within the host. This periplasmic domain (Fbp) has high affinity for ferric iron and serves as the primary receptor for transport. After binding iron with high affinity, Fbp interacts with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. The ferric iron-binding proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge. They have been shown to bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>
