            <td id=al>cd03514 Beta-carotene hydroxylase (CrtR), the carotenoid zeaxanthin biosynthetic enzyme catalyzes the addition of hydroxyl groups to the beta-ionone rings of beta-carotene to form zeaxanthin and is found in bacteria and red algae. Carotenoids are important natural pigments; zeaxanthin and lutein are the only dietary carotenoids that accumulate in the macular region of the retina and lens. It is proposed that these carotenoids protect ocular tissues against photooxidative damage. CrtR does not show overall amino acid sequence similarity to the beta-carotene hydroxylases similar to CrtZ, an astaxanthin biosynthetic beta-carotene hydroxylase. However, CrtR does show sequence similarity to the green alga, Haematococcus pluvialis, beta-carotene ketolase (CrtW), which converts beta-carotene to canthaxanthin. Sequences of the CrtR_beta-carotene-hydroxylase domain family, as well as, the CrtW_beta-carotene-ketolase domain family appear to be structurally related to membrane fatty acid desaturases and alkane hydroxylases. They all share in common extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of these sequences also reveals three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXXH, HXXHH, and HXXHH. These histidine residues are reported to be catalytically essential and proposed to be the ligands for the iron atoms contained within homologs, stearoyl CoA desaturase and alkane hydroxylase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03506 The Delta6 Fatty Acid Desaturase (Delta6-FADS)-like CD includes the integral-membrane enzymes: delta-4, delta-5, delta-6, delta-8, delta-8-sphingolipid, and delta-11 desaturases found in vertebrates, higher plants, fungi, and bacteria. These desaturases are required for the synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), which are mainly esterified into phospholipids and contribute to maintaining membrane fluidity. While HUFAs may be required for cold tolerance in bacteria, plants and fish, the primary role of HUFAs in mammals is cell signaling. These enzymes are described as front-end desaturases because they introduce a double bond between the pre-exiting double bond and the carboxyl (front) end of the fatty acid. Various substrates are involved, with both acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl-lipid desaturases present in this CD. Acyl-lipid desaturases are localized in the membranes of cyanobacterial thylakoid, plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and plastid; and acyl-CoA desaturases are present in ER membrane. ER-bound plant acyl-lipid desaturases and acyl-CoA desaturases require cytochrome b5 as an electron donor. Most of the eukaryotic desaturase domains have an adjacent N-terminal cytochrome b5-like domain. This domain family has extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of sequences also reveals the existence of three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain the residues: HXXXH, HXX(X)HH, and Q/HXXHH. These histidine residues are reported to be catalytically essential and proposed to be the ligands for the iron atoms contained within the homolog, stearoyl CoA desaturase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03509 Fatty acid desaturase protein family subgroup, a delta-12 acyl-lipid desaturase-like, DesA-like, yet uncharacterized subgroup of membrane fatty acid desaturase proteins found in alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacteria. Sequences of this domain family appear to be structurally related to membrane fatty acid desaturases and alkane hydroxylases. They all share in common extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of these sequences also reveals three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXXH, HXXHH, and HXXHH.

            <td id=al>cd01060 The membrane fatty acid desaturase (Membrane_FADS)-like CD includes membrane FADSs, alkane hydroxylases, beta carotene ketolases (CrtW-like), hydroxylases (CrtR-like), and other related proteins. They are present in all groups of organisms with the exception of archaea. Membrane FADSs are non-heme, iron-containing, oxygen-dependent enzymes involved in regioselective introduction of double bonds in fatty acyl aliphatic chains. They play an important role in the maintenance of the proper structure and functioning of biological membranes. Alkane hydroxylases are bacterial, integral-membrane di-iron enzymes that share a requirement for iron and oxygen for activity similar to that of membrane FADSs, and are involved in the initial oxidation of inactivated alkanes. Beta-carotene ketolase and beta-carotene hydroxylase are carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes for astaxanthin and zeaxanthin, respectively. This superfamily domain has extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of these sequences also reveals three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXX(X)H, HXX(X)HH, and HXXHH (an additional conserved histidine residue is seen between clusters 2 and 3). Spectroscopic and genetic evidence point to a nitrogen-rich coordination environment located in the cytoplasm with as many as eight histidines coordinating the two iron ions and a carboxylate residue bridging the two metals in the Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane hydroxylase (AlkB). In addition, the eight histidine residues are reported to be catalytically essential and proposed to be the ligands for the iron atoms contained within the rat stearoyl CoA delta-9 desaturase.</td>
