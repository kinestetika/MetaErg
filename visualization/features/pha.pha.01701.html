            <td id=al>Folate-biopterin transporter of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. The Folate-biopterin transporter (FBT) family includes folate carriers related to those of trypanosomatids in higher plant plastids and cyanobacteria. FBT mediates folate monoglutamate transport involved in tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis. It also mediates transport of antifolates, such as methotrexate and aminopterin. The FBT family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>BT1 family. Members of this family are transmembrane proteins. Several are Leishmania putative proteins that are thought to be pteridine transporters. One such protein, previously termed (and still annotated as) ORFG, was shown to encode a biopterin transport protein using null mutants, thus being subsequently renamed BT1. The significant similarity of ORFG/BT1 to Trypanosoma brucei ESAG10 (a putative transmembrane protein and another member of this family) was previously noted. This family also contains five putative Arabidopsis thaliana proteins of unknown function. In addition, it also contains two predicted prokaryotic proteins (from the cyanobacteria Synechocystis and Synechococcus).</td>

A related protein in Trypanosoma brucei, ESAGIO, shows weak folate/biopterin transport activity. [Cell envelope, Other]</td>

            <td id=al>Major Facilitator Superfamily. The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) is a large and diverse group of secondary transporters that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. MFS proteins facilitate the transport across cytoplasmic or internal membranes of a variety of substrates including ions, sugar phosphates, drugs, neurotransmitters, nucleosides, amino acids, and peptides. They do so using the electrochemical potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins have medical significance in humans such as the glucose transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen storage disease when mutated.</td>

            <td id=al>bacterial MdtG-like and eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. This family is composed of eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family transporters and related bacterial multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters including several proteins from Escherichia coli such as multidrug resistance protein MdtG, from Bacillus subtilis such as multidrug resistance proteins 1 (Bmr1) and 2 (Bmr2), and from Staphylococcus aureus such as quinolone resistance protein NorA. The family also includes Escherichia coli arabinose efflux transporters YfcJ and YhhS. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. The SLC18 transporter family includes vesicular monoamine transporters (VAT1 and VAT2), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and SLC18B1, which is proposed to be a vesicular polyamine transporter (VPAT). The MdtG/SLC18 family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

These proteins are found in photosynthetic organisms. Rhodobacter capsulatus LhaA and PucC are implicated in light-harvesting complex 1 and 2 (LH1 and LH2) assembly. PucC may function to shepherd or sequester LH2 alpha and beta proteins to facilitate proper assembly, as well as deliver bacteriochlorophyll a to nascent LH2 complexes. The BCD family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>
