            <td id=al>cd14770 Alpha subunits of phycoerythrin and phycoerythrocyanin; phycobilisome rod components. phycobilisomes (PBSs) are the main light-harvesting complex in cyanobacteria and red algae. In general, they consist of a central core and surrounding rods and function to harvest and channel light energy toward the photosynthetic reaction centers within the membrane. They are comprised of phycobiliproteins/chromophorylated proteins (PBPs) maintained together by linker polypeptides. PBPs have different numbers of chromophores, and the basic monomer component (alpha/beta heterodimers) can further oligomerize to ring-shaped trimers (heterohexamers) and hexamers (heterododecamers). Stacked PBP hexamers form both the core and the rods of the PBS; the core is mainly made up by allophycocyanin (APC) while the rods can be composed of the PBPs phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC) and phycoerythrocyanin (PEC).</td>

In general, they consist of a central core and surrounding rods and function to harvest and channel light energy toward the photosynthetic reaction centers within the membrane. They are comprised of phycobiliproteins/chromophorylated proteins (PBPs) maintained together by linker polypeptides. PBPs have different numbers of chromophores, and the basic monomer component (alpha/beta heterodimers) can further oligomerize to ring-shaped trimers (heterohexamers) and hexamers (heterododecamers). Stacked PBP hexamers form both the core and the rods of the PBS; the core is mainly made up by allophycocyanin (APC) while the rods can be composed of the PBPs phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC) and phycoerythrocyanin (PEC). This family also contains allophycocyanin-like (Apl) proteins, which conserve the residues critical for chromophore interactions, but may not maintain the proper alpha-beta subunit interactions and tertiary structure of PBPs. The genes encoding the Apl proteins cluster with light-responsive regulatory components, so these may have photoresponsive regulatory role(s). Included in this family is the PBP-like domain of the core-membrane linker polypeptide (LCM). The LCM serves both as a terminal energy acceptor and as a linker polypeptide. Its single phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophore is one of two terminal energy transmitters, and transfers excitations from the hundreds of chromophores of the PBS to the RCs. This family also includes some proteins which have glutathione-S-transferases (GST) domains N-terminal to this PBP-like domain.</td>

This family also includes the beta subunits of Cryptophyte phycobiliproteins which represent another type of biliprotein antenna with different structure and organization. The beta subunits of cryptophyte PBPs share a high degree of sequence identity with both the alpha and beta subunits of the cyanobacterial and red algal PBPs, however the alpha cryptophyte subunits are shorter, and unrelated. There is only one type of PBP present in a single species, either phycocyanin or phycoerythrin, but not allophycocyanin. Structurally, phycoerythrin in cryptophytes is an alpha1alpha2betabeta dimer and not a trimer as in the PBS.</td>
