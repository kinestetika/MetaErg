            <td id=al>uncharacterized subgroup which includes Bacillus subtilis YmaE and related proteins; MBL-fold metallo hydrolase domain. Includes the uncharacterized Bacillus subtilis YmaE and Nostoc all1228 proteins.Members of this subgroup belong to the MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase superfamily which is comprised mainly of hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions. The class B metal beta-lactamases (MBLs) from which this fold was named are only a small fraction of the activities which are included in this superfamily. Activities carried out by superfamily members include class B beta-lactamases, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases, AHL (acyl homoserine lactone) lactonases, persulfide dioxygenases, flavodiiron proteins, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors such as the Int9 and Int11 subunits of Integrator, Sdsa1-like and AtsA-like arylsulfatases, 5'-exonucleases human SNM1A and yeast Pso2p, ribonuclease J and ribonuclease Z, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, insecticide hydrolases, and proteins required for natural transformation competence. Classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, however the diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry. </td>

These proteins include thiolesterases, members of the glyoxalase II family, that catalyse the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione to form glutathione and D-lactic acid and a competence protein that is essential for natural transformation in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and could be a transporter involved in DNA uptake. Except for the competence protein these proteins bind two zinc ions per molecule as cofactor.</td>

            <td id=al>mainly hydrolytic enzymes and related proteins which carry out various biological functions; MBL-fold metallohydrolase domain. Members of the MBL-fold metallohydrolase superfamily are mainly hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions. The class B metal beta-lactamases (MBLs) for which this fold was named perform only a small fraction of the activities included in this superfamily. Activities carried out by superfamily members include class B beta-lactamases which can catalyze the hydrolysis of a wide range of beta-lactam antibiotics, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases (also called glyoxalase II) which hydrolyze S-d-lactoylglutathione to d-lactate in the second step of the glycoxlase system, AHL lactonases which catalyze the hydrolysis and opening of the homoserine lactone rings of acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), persulfide dioxygenase which catalyze the oxidation of glutathione persulfide to glutathione and persulfite in the mitochondria, flavodiiron proteins which catalyze the reduction of oxygen and/or nitric oxide to water or nitrous oxide respectively, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors such as the Int9 and Int11 subunits of Integrator, Sdsa1-like and AtsA-like arylsulfatases, 5'-exonucleases human SNM1A and yeast Pso2p, ribonuclease J which has both 5'-3' exoribonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activity and ribonuclease Z which catalyzes the endonucleolytic removal of the 3' extension of the majority of tRNA precursors, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases which decompose cyclic adenosine and guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP and cGMP) respectively, insecticide hydrolases, and proteins required for natural transformation competence. The diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry, for example classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, human persulfide dioxygenase ETHE1 is a mono-iron binding member of the superfamily; Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases incorporates iron, manganese, and zinc in its dinuclear metal binding site, and flavodiiron proteins contains a diiron site.</td>
