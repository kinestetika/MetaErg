This protein is found in most bacterial genomes in a single copy, but is not present in the Mycoplasmas. It is heterogeneous with respect to the number of repeats of the S1 RNA binding domain described by pfam00575: six repeats in E. coli and most other bacteria, four in Bacillus subtilis and some other species. rpsA is an essential gene in E. coli but not in B. subtilis. It is associated with the cytidylate kinase gene cmk in many species, and fused to it in Treponema pallidum. RpsA is proposed (Medline:97323001) to assist in mRNA degradation. This model provides trusted hits to most long form (6 repeat) examples of RpsA. Among homologs with only four repeats are some to which other (perhaps secondary) functions have been assigned.

Mutational studies have shown that each region represents a specific functional domain. Deletions within the S1-containing region inhibit pre-rRNA processing at either site A3 or A2, whereas deletions within the TPR region confer an inability to support cleavage of A0-A2.

It is a trimeric multidomain protein. The C-terminus contains the S1 domain which binds ssRNA. This family is classified based on the S1 domain. PNPase nonspecifically removes the 3' nucleotides from mRNA, but is stalled by double-stranded RNA structures such as a stem-loop. Evidence shows that a minimum of 7-10 unpaired nucleotides at the 3' end, is required for PNPase degradation. It is suggested that PNPase also dephosphorylates the RNA 5' end. This additional activity may regulate the 5'-dependent activity of RNaseE in vivo.</td>

The bacterial RPS1 domain architecture consists of 4-6 tandem S1 domains. In some bacteria, the tandem S1 array is located C-terminal to a 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HMBPP reductase) domain. While RPS1 is found primarily in bacteria, proteins with tandem RPS1-like domains have been identified in plants and humans, however these lack the N-terminal HMBPP reductase domain. This CD includes S1 repeat 1 of the Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens RPS1 (ec1 and hs1, respectively). Autoantibodies to double-stranded DNA from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus cross-react with the human RPS1 homolog.</td>

The tex gene is essential in Bortella pertusis and is named for its role in toxin expression. Tex has two functional domains, an N-terminal domain homologous to the Escherichia coli maltose repression protein, which is a poorly defined transcriptional factor, and a C-terminal S1 RNA-binding domain.

Rrp5 has two distinct regions, an N-terminal region containing tandemly repeated S1 RNA-binding domains (12 S1 repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rrp5 and 14 S1 repeats in Homo sapiens Rrp5) and a C-terminal region containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Mutational studies have shown that each region represents a specific functional domain. Deletions within the S1-containing region inhibit pre-rRNA processing at either site A3 or A2, whereas deletions within the TPR region confer an inability to support cleavage of A0-A2. This CD includes H. sapiens S1 repeat 6 (hs6) and S. cerevisiae S1 repeat 5 (sc5). Rrp5 is found in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes or archaea.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04452 S1_IF2_alpha: The alpha subunit of translation Initiation Factor 2, S1-like RNA-binding domain. S1-like RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated proteins. Eukaryotic and archaeal Initiation Factor 2 (e- and aIF2, respectively) are heterotrimeric proteins with three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma). IF2 plays a crucial role in the process of translation initiation. The IF2 gamma subunit contains a GTP-binding site. The IF2 beta and gamma subunits together are thought to be responsible for binding methionyl-initiator tRNA. The ternary complex consisting of IF2, GTP, and the methionyl-initiator tRNA binds to the small subunit of the ribosome, as part of a pre-initiation complex that scans the mRNA to find the AUG start codon. The IF2-bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP when the methionyl-initiator tRNA binds the AUG start codon, at which time the IF2 is released with its bound GDP. The large ribosomal subunit then joins with the small subunit to complete the initiation complex, which is competent to begin translation. The IF2a subunit is a major site of control of the translation initiation process, via phosphorylation of a specific serine residue. This alpha subunit is well conserved in eukaryotes and archaea but is not present in bacteria. IF2 is a cold-shock-inducible protein.</td>
