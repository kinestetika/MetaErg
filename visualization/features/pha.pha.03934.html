PatA contains phosphoacceptor REC domain at its C-terminus and an N-terminal PATAN (PatA N-terminus) domain, which was proposed in a bioinformatics study to mediate protein-protein interactions. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.

Cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase response regulator RpfG, together with sensory/regulatory protein RpfC, constitute a two-component system implicated in sensing and responding to the diffusible signal factor (DSF) that is essential for cell-cell signaling. RpfC is a hybrid sensor/histidine kinase that phosphorylates and activates RpfG, which degrades cyclic di-GMP to GMP, leading to the activation of Clp, a global transcriptional regulator that regulates a large set of genes in the DSF pathway. RpfG contains a CheY-like receiver domain attached to a histidine-aspartic acid-glycine-tyrosine-proline (HD-GYP) cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase domain.

They are involved in the control of environmental stress tolerance (such as the oxidative, osmotic and acid stress response), motility, virulence, outer membrane biogenesis and other processes.

            <td id=al>cd00156 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of response regulators (RRs) and pseudo response regulators (PRRs). Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

Dictyostelium discoideum hybrid signal transduction histidine kinase D (DhkD) is a large protein that contains two histidine kinase (HK) and two REC domains on the intracellular side of a single pass transmembrane domain, and extracellular PAS and PAC domains that likely are involved in ligand binding. This model represents the second REC domain and similar domains. DhkD activates the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA to ensure proper prestalk and prespore patterning, tip formation, and the vertical elongation of the mound into a finger, in Dictyostelium discoideum. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

Rcp1, Tolypothrix sp. RcpA, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacteriophytochrome response regulator AtBRR. They are stand-alone RRs containing only a REC domain with no output/effector domain. The REC domain itself functions as an effector domain. Also included in this family us Methanosaeta harundinacea methanogenesis regulatory protein FilR2, also a stand-alone RR.

            <td id=al>cd17546 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CKI1 and Escherichia coli RcsC. This family is composed of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators that are sensor histidine kinases (HKs) fused with a REC domain, similar to the sensor histidine kinase CKI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) signaling that mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. MSP involves a signal being transferred from HKs via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. The CKI1 REC domain specifically interacts with the downstream signaling protein AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. The plant MSP system has evolved from the prokaryotic two-component system (TCS), which allows organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. This family also includes bacterial hybrid sensor HKs such as Escherichia coli RcsC, which is a component of the Rcs signalling pathway that controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division, and motility.

Typically, two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) consist of a sensor (histidine kinase) that responds to specific input(s) by modifying the output of a cognate response regulator (RR). TCSs allow organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. Hybrid sensor histidine kinase/response regulators contain all the elements of a classical TCS in a single polypeptide chain. RRs share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains.

In unicellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis, MtrAB coordinates DNA replication with cell division and regulates the transcription of resuscitation-promoting factor B. In filamentous Streptomyces venezuelae, it links antibiotic production to sporulation. MtrA belongs to the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators that contain N-terminal receiver (REC) and C-terminal DNA-binding winged helix-turn-helix effector domains.

When activated, PhoPR directs expression of phosphate scavenging enzymes, lowers synthesis of the phosphate-rich wall teichoic acid (WTA) and initiates synthesis of teichuronic acid, a non-phosphate containing replacement anionic polymer. Members of this subfamily belong to the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators, which are characterized by a REC domain and a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding output effector domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
