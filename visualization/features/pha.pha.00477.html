            <td id=al>Activator of bc1 complex (ABC1) kinases (also called aarF domain containing kinase 3) and similar proteins. This family is composed of the atypical yeast protein kinase Abc1p, its human homolog ADCK3 (also called CABC1), and similar proteins. Abc1p (also called Coq8p) is required for the biosynthesis of Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q), which is an essential lipid component in respiratory electron and proton transport. It is necessary for the formation of a multi-subunit Q-biosynthetic complex and may also function in the regulation of Q synthesis. Human ADCK3 is able to rescue defects in Q synthesis and the phosphorylation state of Coq proteins in yeast Abc1 (or Coq8) mutants. Mutations in ADCK3 cause progressive cerebellar ataxia and atrophy due to Q10 deficiency. Eukaryotes contain at least two more ABC1/ADCK3-like proteins: in humans, these are the putative atypical protein kinases named ADCK1 and ADCK2. In algae and higher plants, ABC1 kinases have proliferated to more than 15 subfamilies, most of which are located in plastids or mitochondria. Eight of these plant ABC1 kinase subfamilies (ABC1K1-8) are specific for photosynthetic organisms. ABC1 kinases are not related to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter family.</td>

            <td id=al>2-polyprenylphenol 6-hydroxylase. This model represents the enzyme (UbiB) which catalyzes the first hydroxylation step in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. It is believed that the reaction is 2-polyprenylphenol -> 6-hydroxy-2-polyprenylphenol. This model finds hits primarily in the proteobacteria. The gene is also known as AarF in certain species.

It is required for the biosynthesis of Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q), which is an essential lipid component in respiratory electron and proton transport. It is required in the first monooxygenase step in Q biosynthesis. Mutant strains with disrupted ubiB genes lack Q and accumulate octaprenylphenol, a Q biosynthetic intermediate.</td>

            <td id=al>ABC1 family. This family includes ABC1 from yeast and AarF from E. coli. These proteins have a nuclear or mitochondrial subcellular location in eukaryotes. The exact molecular functions of these proteins is not clear, however yeast ABC1 suppresses a cytochrome b mRNA translation defect and is essential for the electron transfer in the bc 1 complex and E. coli AarF is required for ubiquinone production. It has been suggested that members of the ABC1 family are novel chaperonins. These proteins are unrelated to the ABC transporter proteins.</td>
