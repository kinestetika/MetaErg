            <td id=al>cd08562 Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain in Escherichia coli cytosolic glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase UgpQ and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain (GDPD) present in Escherichia coli cytosolic glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GP-GDE, EC 3.1.4.46), UgpQ, and similar proteins. GP-GDE plays an essential role in the metabolic pathway of E. coli. It catalyzes the degradation of glycerophosphodiesters to produce sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols, which are major sources of carbon and phosphate. E. coli possesses two major G3P uptake systems: Glp and Ugp, which contain genes coding for two distinct GP-GDEs. UgpQ gene from the E. coli ugp operon codes for a cytosolic phosphodiesterase GlpQ, which is the prototype of this family. Various glycerophosphodiesters, such as glycerophosphocholine (GPC), glycerophosphoethanolanmine (GPE), glycerophosphoglycerol (GPG), glycerophosphoinositol (GPI), and glycerophosphoserine (GPS), can only be hydrolyzed by UgpQ during transport at the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane to alcohols and G3P, which is a source of phosphate. In contrast to Ca2+-dependent periplasmic phosphodiesterase GlpQ, cytosolic phosphodiesterase UgpQ requires divalent cations, such as Mg2+, Co2+, or Mn2+, for its enzyme activity.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08556 Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain as found in prokaryota and eukaryota, and similar proteins. The typical glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain (GDPD) consists of a TIM barrel and a small insertion domain named the GDPD-insertion (GDPD-I) domain, which is specific for GDPD proteins. This family corresponds to both typical GDPD domain and GDPD-like domain which lacks the GDPD-I region. Members in this family mainly consist of a large family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GP-GDEs, EC 3.1.4.46), and a number of uncharacterized homologs. Sphingomyelinases D (SMases D) (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase D, EC 3.1.4.41) from spider venom, SMases D-like proteins, and phospholipase D (PLD) from several pathogenic bacteria are also included in this family. GDPD plays an essential role in glycerol metabolism and catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols are major sources of carbon and phosphate. Its catalytic mechanism is based on the metal ion-dependent acid-base reaction, which is similar to that of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLCs, EC 3.1.4.11). Both, GDPD related proteins and PI-PLCs, belong to the superfamily of PI-PLC-like phosphodiesterases.</td>

This subfamily corresponds to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain (GDPD) present in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (TtGDE, EC 3.1.4.46) and its uncharacterized homologs. Members in this family show high sequence similarity to Escherichia coli GP-GDE, which catalyzes the degradation of glycerophosphodiesters to produce sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols. Despite the fact that most of GDPD family members exist as the monomer, TtGDE can function as a dimeric unit. Its catalytic mechanism is based on the general base-acid catalysis, which is similar to that of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLCs, EC 3.1.4.11). A divalent metal cation is required for the enzyme activity of TtGDE.</td>

This subfamily corresponds to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain (GDPD) present in a group of uncharacterized cytoplasmic phosphodiesterases which predominantly exist in bacteria. The prototype of this family is a putative cytoplasmic phosphodiesterase encoded by gene ulpQ2 (SCO1419) in the Streptomyces coelicolor genome. It is distantly related to the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic phosphodiesterases UgpQ that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters at the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane to produce sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols.</td>

This subfamily corresponds to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain (GDPD) present in mammalian GDE1 (also known as MIR16, membrane interacting protein of RGS16) and their metazoan homologs. GDE1 is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, including the heart, brain, liver, and kidney. It shows sequence homology to bacterial glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GP-GDEs, EC 3.1.4.46), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of various glycerophosphodiesters, and produce sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols. GDE1 has been characterized as GPI-GDE (EC 3.1.4.44) that selectively hydrolyzes extracellular glycerophosphoinositol (GPI) to generate glycerol phosphate and inositol. It functions as an integral membrane-bound glycoprotein interacting with regulator of G protein signaling protein RGS16, and is modulated by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. In addition, GDE1 may interact with PRA1 domain family, member 2 (PRAF2, also known as JM4), which is an interacting protein of the G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CCR5. The catalytic activity, which is dependent on the integrity of the GDPD domain, is required for GDE1 cellular function.</td>

Mammalian GDE4 is a transmembrane protein whose cellular function is not elucidated. It is expressed widely, including in placenta, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, small intestine and peripheral blood leukocytes. It is also expressed in the growth cones in neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells, which suggests mammalian GDE4 may play some distinct role from other members of mammalian GDEs family.

GP-GDEs are involved in glycerol metabolism and catalyze the degradation of glycerophosphodiesters to produce sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols, which are major sources of carbon and phosphate. In E. coli, there are two major G3P uptake systems: Glp and Ugp, which contain genes coding for two different GP-GDEs. GlpQ gene from the glp operon codes for a periplasmic phosphodiesterase GlpQ. GlpQ is a dimeric enzyme that hydrolyzes periplasmic glycerophosphodiesters, such as glycerophosphocholine (GPC), glycerophosphoethanolanmine (GPE), glycerophosphoglycerol (GPG), glycerophosphoinositol (GPI), and glycerophosphoserine (GPS), to the corresponding alcohols and G3P, which is subsequently transported into the cell through the GlpT transport system. Ca2+ is required for GlpQ enzymatic activity. This subfamily also includes some GP-GDEs in higher plants and their eukaryotic homologs, which show very high sequence similarities with bacterial periplasmic GP-GDEs.</td>

This subfamily corresponds to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain (GDPD) present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPL206cp and uncharacterized hypothetical homologs existing in fungi. The product of S. cerevisiae ORF YPL206c (PGC1), YPL206cp (Pgc1p), displays homology to bacterial and mammalian glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GP-GDE, EC 3.1.4.46), which catalyzes the degradation of glycerophosphodiesters to produce sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols. S. cerevisiae YPL206cp is an integral membrane protein with a single GDPD domain following by a short hydrophobic C-terminal tail that may function as a membrane anchor. This protein plays an essential role in the regulation of the cardiolipin (CL) biosynthetic pathway in yeast by removing the excess phosphatidylglycerol (PG) content of membranes via a phospholipase C-type degradation mechanism. YPL206cp has been characterized as a PG-specific phospholipase C that selectively catalyzes the cleavage of PG, not glycerophosphoinositol (GPI) or glycerophosphocholine (GPC), to diacylglycerol (DAG) and glycerophosphate.  Members in this family are distantly related to S. cerevisiae YPL110cp, which selectively hydrolyzes glycerophosphocholine (GPC), not glycerophosphoinositol (GPI), to generate choline and glycerolphosphate, and has been characterized as a cytoplasmic GPC-specific phosphodiesterase.</td>

This subfamily corresponds to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain (GDPD) present in mammalian glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain-containing protein subtype 5 (GDE2), subtype 2 (GDE3), subtype 1 (GDE6), and their eukaryotic homologs. Mammalian GDE2, GDE3, and GDE6 show very high sequence similarity to each other and have been classified into the same family. Although they are all transmembrane proteins, based on different pattern of tissue distribution, these enzymes might display diverse cellular functions. Mammalian GDE2 is primarily expressed in mature neurons. It selectively hydrolyzes glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and mainly functions in a complex with an antioxidant scavenger peroxiredoxin1 (Prdx1) to control motor neuron differentiation in the spinal cord.  Mammalian GDE3 is specifically expressed in bone tissues and spleen. It selectively hydrolyzes extracellular glycerophosphoinositol (GPI) to generate inositol 1-phosphate (Ins1P) and glycerol and functions as an inducer of osteoblast differentiation. Mammalian GDE6 is predominantly expressed in the spermatocytes of testis, and its specific physiological function has not been elucidated yet.</td>

Mammalian GDE4 is a transmembrane protein whose cellular function has not yet been elucidated. It is expressed widely, including in placenta, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, small intestine and peripheral blood leukocytes. It is also expressed in the growth cones in neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells, which suggests GDE4 may play some distinct role from other members of the GDE family.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08555 Catalytic domain of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-like phosphodiesterases superfamily. The PI-PLC-like phosphodiesterases superfamily represents the catalytic domains of bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, EC 4.6.1.13), eukaryotic phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, EC 3.1.4.11), glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GP-GDE, EC 3.1.4.46), sphingomyelinases D (SMases D) (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase D, EC 3.1.4.41) from spider venom, SMases D-like proteins, and phospholipase D (PLD) from several pathogenic bacteria, as well as their uncharacterized homologs found in organisms ranging from bacteria and archaea to metazoans, plants, and fungi. PI-PLCs are ubiquitous enzymes hydrolyzing the membrane lipid phosphoinositides to yield two important second messengers, inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol (DAG). GP-GDEs play essential roles in glycerol metabolism and catalyze the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols that are major sources of carbon and phosphate. Both, PI-PLCs and GP-GDEs, can hydrolyze the 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds in different substrates, and utilize a similar mechanism of general base and acid catalysis with conserved histidine residues, which consists of two steps, a phosphotransfer and a phosphodiesterase reaction. This superfamily also includes Neurospora crassa ankyrin repeat protein NUC-2 and its Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterpart, Phosphate system positive regulatory protein PHO81, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GP-GDE)-like protein SHV3 and SHV3-like proteins (SVLs). The residues essential for enzyme activities and metal binding are not conserved in these sequence homologs, which might suggest that the function of catalytic domains in these proteins might be distinct from those in typical PLC-like phosphodiesterases.</td>

Mammalian GDE3 functions as an inducer of osteoblast differentiation. It also plays a critical role for actin cytoskeletal modulation. The catalytic activity of GDPD domain is essential for mammalian GDE3 cellular function.</td>

This subfamily corresponds to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain (GDPD) present in Escherichia coli periplasmic glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GP-GDE, EC 3.1.4.46), GlpQ, and similar proteins. GP-GDE plays an essential role in the metabolic pathway of E. coli. It catalyzes the degradation of glycerophosphodiesters to produce sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and the corresponding alcohols, which are major sources of carbon and phosphate. E. coli possesses two major G3P uptake systems: Glp and Ugp, which contain genes coding for two different GP-GDEs. GlpQ gene from the E. coli glp operon codes for a periplasmic phosphodiesterase GlpQ, which is the prototype of this family. GlpQ is a dimeric enzyme that hydrolyzes periplasmic glycerophosphodiesters, such as glycerophosphocholine (GPC), glycerophosphoethanolanmine (GPE), glycerophosphoglycerol (GPG), glycerophosphoinositol (GPI), and glycerophosphoserine (GPS), to the corresponding alcohols and G3P, which is subsequently transported into the cell through the GlpT transport system. Ca2+ is required for the enzymatic activity of GlpQ.  This family also includes a surface-exposed lipoprotein, protein D (HPD), from Haemophilus influenza Type b and nontypeable strains, which shows very high sequence similarity with E. coli GlpQ. HPD has been characterized as a human immunoglobulin D-binding protein with glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity. It can hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine from host membranes to produce free choline on the lipopolysaccharides on the surface of pathogenic bacteria.</td>
