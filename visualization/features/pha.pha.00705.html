            <td id=al>cd02690 M28 Zn-peptidases include aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases. Peptidase M28 family (also called aminopeptidase Y family) contains aminopeptidases as well as carboxypeptidases. They have co-catalytic zinc ions; each zinc ion is tetrahedrally co-ordinated, with three amino acid ligands plus activated water; one aspartate residue binds both metal ions. The aminopeptidases in this family are also called bacterial leucyl aminopeptidases, but are able to release a variety of N-terminal amino acids. IAP aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase Y preferentially release basic amino acids while glutamate carboxypeptidase II preferentially releases C-terminal glutamates. Plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase (PGCP) and glutamate carboxypeptidase II (NAALADase) hydrolyze dipeptides. Several members of the M28 peptidase family have PA domain inserts which may participate in substrate binding and/or in promoting conformational changes, which influence the stability and accessibility of the site to substrate. These include prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), yeast aminopeptidase S (SGAP), human transferrin receptors (TfR1 and TfR2), plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase (PGCP) and several predicted aminopeptidases where relatively little is known about them. Also included in the M28 family are glutaminyl cyclases (QC), which are involved in N-terminal glutamine cyclization of many endocrine peptides. Nicastrin and nicalin belong to this family but lack the amino-acid conservation required for catalytically active aminopeptidases.</td>

Peptidase family M28; Streptomyces griseus Aminopeptidase (SGAP, Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), aminopeptidase S, Mername-AA022 peptidase) subfamily. SGAP is a di-zinc exopeptidase with high preference towards large hydrophobic amino-terminal residues, with Leu being the most efficiently cleaved. It can accommodate all except Pro and Glu residues in the P1' position. It is a monomeric (30 kDa), calcium-activated and calcium-stabilized enzyme; its activation by calcium correlates with substrate specificity and it has thermal stability only in the presence of calcium. Although SGAP contains a calcium binding site, it is not conserved in many members of this subfamily. SGAP is present in the extracellular fluid of S. griseus cultures.</td>

ERMP1 is a multi-pass membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In humans, Fxna may play a crucial role in processing proteins required for the organization of somatic cells and oocytes into discrete follicular structures, although which proteins are hydrolyzed has not yet been determined. Another member of this subfamily is the 24-kDa vacuolar protein (VP24) which is probably involved in the formation of intravacuolar pigmented globules (cyanoplasts) in highly anthocyanin-containing vacuoles; however, the biological function of the C-terminal region which includes the putative transmembrane metallopeptidase domain is unknown.</td>

Peptidase family M28; Aeromonas (Vibrio) proteolytica aminopeptidase (AAP; leucine aminopeptidase from Vibrio proteolyticus; Bacterial leucyl aminopeptidase; E.C. 3.4.11.10) subfamily. AAP is a small (32kDa), heat stable leucine aminopeptidase and is active as a monomer. Similar forms of the enzyme have been isolated from Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus thermophilus. Leucine aminopeptidases, in general, play important roles in many biological processes such as protein catabolism, hormone degradation, regulation of migration and cell proliferation, as well as HIV infection and proliferation. AAP is a broad-specificity enzyme, utilizing two zinc(II) ions in its active site to remove N-terminal amino acids, with preference for large hydrophobic amino acids in the P1 position of the substrate, Leu being the most efficiently cleaved. It can accommodate all residues, except Pro, Asp and Glu in the P1' position.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03884 M20 Peptidase beta-alanine synthase, an amidohydrolase. Peptidase M20 family, beta-alanine synthase (bAS; N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine amidohydrolase and beta-ureidopropionase; EC 3.5.1.6) subfamily. bAS is an amidohydrolase and is the final enzyme in the pyrimidine catabolic pathway, which is involved in the regulation of the cellular pyrimidine pool. bAS catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of the N-carbamylated beta-amino acids to beta-alanine or aminoisobutyrate with the release of carbon dioxide and ammonia. Also included in this subfamily is allantoate amidohydrolase (allantoate deiminase), which catalyzes the conversion of allantoate to (S)-ureidoglycolate, one of the crucial alternate steps in purine metabolism. It is possible that these two enzymes arose from the same ancestral peptidase that evolved into two structurally related enzymes with distinct catalytic properties and biochemical roles within the cell. Downstream enzyme (S)-ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase (UAH) is homologous in structure and sequence with AAH and catalyzes the conversion of (S)-ureidoglycolate into glyoxylate, releasing two molecules of ammonia as by-products. Yeast requires beta-alanine as a precursor of pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis, but generates it mostly via degradation of spermine. Disorders in pyrimidine degradation and beta-alanine metabolism caused by beta-ureidopropionase deficiency (UPB1 gene) in humans are normally associated with neurological disorders.</td>
