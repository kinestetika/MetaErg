            <td id=al>cd03013 Peroxiredoxin (PRX) family, PRX5-like subfamily; members are similar to the human protein, PRX5, a homodimeric TRX peroxidase, widely expressed in tissues and found cellularly in mitochondria, peroxisomes and the cytosol. The cellular location of PRX5 suggests that it may have an important antioxidant role in organelles that are major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as a role in the control of signal transduction. PRX5 has been shown to reduce hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides and peroxynitrite. As with all other PRXs, the N-terminal peroxidatic cysteine of PRX5 is oxidized into a sulfenic acid intermediate upon reaction with peroxides. Human PRX5 is able to resolve this intermediate by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond with its C-terminal cysteine (the resolving cysteine), which can then be reduced by TRX, just like an atypical 2-cys PRX. This resolving cysteine, however, is not conserved in other members of the subfamily. In such cases, it is assumed that the oxidized cysteine is directly resolved by an external small-molecule or protein reductant, typical of a 1-cys PRX. In the case of the H. influenza PRX5 hybrid, the resolving glutaredoxin domain is on the same protein chain as PRX. PRX5 homodimers show an A-type interface, similar to atypical 2-cys PRXs.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03029 Glutaredoxin (GRX) family, PRX5 hybrid subfamily; composed of hybrid proteins containing peroxiredoxin (PRX) and GRX domains, which is found in some pathogenic bacteria and cyanobacteria. PRXs are thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins that confer a protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either thioredoxin, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF. GRX is a glutathione (GSH) dependent reductase, catalyzing the disulfide reduction of target proteins. PRX-GRX hybrid proteins from Haemophilus influenza and Neisseria meningitis exhibit GSH-dependent peroxidase activity. The flow of reducing equivalents in the catalytic cycle of the hybrid protein goes from NADPH -> GSH reductase -> GSH -> GRX domain of hybrid -> PRX domain of hybrid -> peroxide substrate.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02971 Peroxiredoxin (PRX) family; composed of the different classes of PRXs including many proteins originally known as bacterioferritin comigratory proteins (BCP), based on their electrophoretic mobility before their function was identified. PRXs are thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins also known as TRX peroxidases and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C22 (AhpC) proteins. They confer a protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either TRX, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF. They are distinct from other peroxidases in that they have no cofactors such as metals or prosthetic groups. The first step of catalysis, common to all PRXs, is the nucleophilic attack by the catalytic cysteine (also known as the peroxidatic cysteine) on the peroxide leading to cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond and the formation of a cysteine sulfenic acid intermediate. The second step of the reaction, the resolution of the intermediate, distinguishes the different types of PRXs. The presence or absence of a second cysteine (the resolving cysteine) classifies PRXs as either belonging to the 2-cys or 1-cys type. The resolving cysteine of 2-cys PRXs is either on the same chain (atypical) or on the second chain (typical) of a functional homodimer. Structural and motif analysis of this growing family supports the need for a new classification system. The peroxidase activity of PRXs is regulated in vivo by irreversible cysteine over-oxidation into a sulfinic acid, phosphorylation and limited proteolysis.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02066 Glutaredoxin (GRX) family; composed of GRX, approximately 10 kDa in size, and proteins containing a GRX or GRX-like domain. GRX is a glutathione (GSH) dependent reductase, catalyzing the disulfide reduction of target proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase. It contains a redox active CXXC motif in a TRX fold and uses a similar dithiol mechanism employed by TRXs for intramolecular disulfide bond reduction of protein substrates. Unlike TRX, GRX has preference for mixed GSH disulfide substrates, in which it uses a monothiol mechanism where only the N-terminal cysteine is required. The flow of reducing equivalents in the GRX system goes from NADPH -> GSH reductase -> GSH -> GRX -> protein substrates. By altering the redox state of target proteins, GRX is involved in many cellular functions including DNA synthesis, signal transduction and the defense against oxidative stress. Different classes are known including human GRX1 and GRX2, as well as E. coli GRX1 and GRX3, which are members of this family. E. coli GRX2, however, is a 24-kDa protein that belongs to the GSH S-transferase (GST) family.</td>

Oxidized glutathione is regenerated by glutathione reductase. Together these components compose the glutathione system. Glutaredoxins utilize the CXXC motif common to thioredoxins and are involved in multiple cellular processes including protection from redox stress, reduction of critical enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase and the generation of reduced sulfur for iron sulfur cluster formation. Glutaredoxins are capable of reduction of mixed disulfides of glutathione as well as the formation of glutathione mixed disulfides. This model represents eukaryotic glutaredoxins and includes sequences from fungi, plants and metazoans as well as viruses.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02976 NrdH-redoxin (NrdH) family; NrdH is a small monomeric protein with a conserved redox active CXXC motif within a TRX fold, characterized by a glutaredoxin (GRX)-like sequence and TRX-like activity profile. In vitro, it displays protein disulfide reductase activity that is dependent on TRX reductase, not glutathione (GSH). It is part of the NrdHIEF operon, where NrdEF codes for class Ib ribonucleotide reductase (RNR-Ib), an efficient enzyme at low oxygen levels. Under these conditions when GSH is mostly conjugated to spermidine, NrdH can still function and act as a hydrogen donor for RNR-Ib. It has been suggested that the NrdHEF system may be the oldest RNR reducing system, capable of functioning in a microaerophilic environment, where GSH was not yet available. NrdH from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes can form domain-swapped dimers, although it is unknown if this happens in vivo. Domain-swapped dimerization, which results in the blocking of the TRX reductase binding site, could be a mechanism for regulating the oxidation state of the protein.</td>
