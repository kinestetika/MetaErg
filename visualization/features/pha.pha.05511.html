            <td id=al>hopanoid-associated sugar epimerase. The sequences in this family are members of the pfam01370 superfamily of NAD-dependent epimerases and dehydratases typically acting on nucleotide-sugar substrates. The genes of the family modeled here are generally in the same locus with genes involved in the biosynthesis and elaboration of hopene, the cyclization product of the polyisoprenoid squalene. This gene and its association with hopene biosynthesis in Zymomonas mobilis has been noted in the literature where the gene symbol hpnA was assigned. Hopanoids are known to be components of the plasma membrane and to have polar sugar head groups in Z. mobilis and other species.</td>

            <td id=al>uncharacterized subgroup of aldehyde reductase and flavonoid reductase related proteins, extended (e) SDRs. This subgroup contains proteins of unknown function related to aldehyde reductase and flavonoid reductase of the extended SDR-type. Aldehyde reductase I (aka carbonyl reductase) is an NADP-binding SDR; it has an NADP-binding motif consensus that is slightly different from the canonical SDR form and lacks the Asn of the extended SDR active site tetrad. Aldehyde reductase I catalyzes the NADP-dependent  reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate. The related flavonoid reductases act in the NADP-dependent reduction of  flavonoids, ketone-containing plant secondary metabolites. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

            <td id=al>3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3b-HSD)-like, extended (e) SDRs. Extended SDR family domains belonging to this subgroup have the characteristic active site tetrad and a fairly well-conserved NAD(P)-binding motif. 3b-HSD catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of various steroids, such as pregnenolone to progesterone, or androstenediol to testosterone. This subgroup includes an unusual bifunctional 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase from Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG26, a 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase, involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol of yeast. It also includes human 3 beta-HSD/HSD3B1 and C(27) 3beta-HSD/ [3beta-hydroxy-delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase; HSD3B7].  C(27) 3beta-HSD/HSD3B7 is a membrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum, that catalyzes the isomerization and oxidation of 7alpha-hydroxylated sterol intermediates, an early step in bile acid biosynthesis. Mutations in the human NSDHL (NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein) cause CHILD syndrome (congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects), an X-linked dominant, male-lethal trait. Mutations in the human gene encoding C(27) 3beta-HSD underlie a rare autosomal recessive form of neonatal cholestasis. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids.

These FRs act in the NADP-dependent reduction of  flavonoids, ketone-containing plant secondary metabolites; they have the characteristic active site triad of the SDRs (though not the upstream active site Asn) and a NADP-binding motif that is very similar to the typical extended SDR motif.

Human NSDHL is a 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) which functions in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.  3 beta-HSD catalyzes the oxidative conversion of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids to the delta 4-3-keto configuration; this activity is essential for the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids.

Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs.

Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. In addition to the Rossmann fold core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN).

Proteins in this subgroup have the characteristic active site tetrad and NAD(P)-binding motif of extended-SDRs. 3 beta-HSD catalyzes the oxidative conversion of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids to the delta 4-3-keto configuration; this activity is essential for the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids.

SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing.

Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>Arabidopsis thaliana GDP-mannose-3',5'-epimerase (GME)-like, extended (e) SDRs. This subgroup of NDP-sugar epimerase/dehydratases are extended SDRs; they have the characteristic active site tetrad, and an NAD-binding motif: TGXXGXX[AG], which is a close match to the canonical NAD-binding motif. Members include Arabidopsis thaliana GDP-mannose-3',5'-epimerase (GME) which catalyzes the epimerization of two positions of GDP-alpha-D-mannose to form GDP-beta-L-galactose. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

            <td id=al>phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase (PCBER) like, atypical (a) SDRs. PCBER and pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases are NADPH-dependent aromatic alcohol reductases, and are atypical members of the SDR family. Other proteins in this subgroup are identified as eugenol synthase. These proteins contain an N-terminus characteristic of NAD(P)-binding proteins and a small C-terminal domain presumed to be involved in substrate binding, but they do not have the conserved active site Tyr residue typically found in SDRs. Numerous other members have unknown functions. The glycine rich NADP-binding motif in this subgroup is of 2 forms: GXGXXG and G[GA]XGXXG; it tends to be atypical compared with the forms generally seen in classical or extended SDRs. The usual SDR active site tetrad is not present, but a critical active site Lys at the usual SDR position has been identified in various members, though other charged and polar residues are found at this position in this subgroup. Atypical SDR-related proteins retain the Rossmann fold of the SDRs, but have limited sequence identity and generally lack the catalytic properties of the archetypical members. Atypical SDRs include biliverdin IX beta reductase (BVR-B,aka flavin reductase), NMRa (a negative transcriptional regulator of various fungi), progesterone 5-beta-reductase like proteins, phenylcoumaran benzylic ether and pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases, phenylpropene synthases, eugenol synthase, triphenylmethane reductase, isoflavone reductases, and others.

This subgroup includes Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 HetN, a putative oxidoreductase involved in heterocyst differentiation, and related proteins.  SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering).

            <td id=al>atypical (a) SDRs, subgroup 4. Atypical SDRs in this subgroup are poorly defined, one member is identified as a putative NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase. Atypical SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. Members of this subgroup have a glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif that is related to, but is different from, the archetypical SDRs, GXGXXG. This subgroup also lacks most of the characteristic active site residues of the SDRs; however, the upstream Ser is present at the usual place, and some potential catalytic residues are present in place of the usual YXXXK active site motif. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs.
