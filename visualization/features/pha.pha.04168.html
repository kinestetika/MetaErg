            <td id=al>TIGR02000 Fe-S cluster assembly protein NifU. Three different but partially homologous Fe-S cluster assembly systems have been described: Isc, Suf, and Nif. The latter is associated with donation of an Fe-S cluster to nitrogenase in a number of nitrogen-fixing species. NifU, described here, consists of an N-terminal domain (pfam01592) and a C-terminal domain (pfam01106). Homologs with an equivalent domain archictecture from Helicobacter and Campylobacter, however, are excluded from this model by a high trusted cutoff. The model, therefore, is specific for NifU involved in nitrogenase maturation. The related model TIGR01999 homologous to the N-terminus of this model describes IscU from the Isc system as in E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens.

            <td id=al>pfam01592 NifU-like N terminal domain. This domain is found in NifU in combination with pfam01106. This domain is found on isolated in several bacterial species. The nif genes are responsible for nitrogen fixation. However this domain is found in bacteria that do not fix nitrogen, so it may have a broader significance in the cell than nitrogen fixation. These proteins appear to be scaffold proteins for iron-sulfur clusters.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06664 Iron-sulfur cluster scaffold-like proteins. IscU_like and NifU_like proteins. IscU and NifU function as a scaffold for the assembly of [2Fe-2S] clusters before they are transferred to apo target proteins. They are highly conserved and play vital roles in the ISC and NIF systems of Fe-S protein maturation. NIF genes participate in nitrogen fixation in several isolated bacterial species. The NifU domain, however, is also found in bacteria that do not fix nitrogen, so it may have wider significance in the cell. Human IscU interacts with frataxin, the Friedreich ataxia gene product, and incorrectly spliced IscU has been shown to disrupt iron homeostasis in skeletal muscle and cause myopathy.</td>

            <td id=al>cd19947 bacterioferritin-associated ferredoxin (BFD)-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain of nitrogen fixation protein NifU and similar proteins. This family includes the BFD-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain of Azotobacter vinelandii and Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogen fixation protein NifU. NifU binds one Fe cation per subunit and one [2Fe-2S] cluster per subunit, and is involved in the formation or repair of [Fe-S] clusters present in iron-sulfur proteins. The BFD-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain is found in a variety of other proteins including bacterioferritin-associated ferredoxin (BFD), the large subunit of NADH-dependent nitrite reductase, and Cu+ chaperone CopZ. It comprises a helix-turn-helix fold, and binds an [2Fe-2S] cluster via 4 highly-conserved Cys residues, found in loops between the alpha-helices. For the class of proteins having a BFD-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain, the Cys residues are organized in a unique C-X2-C-X31-35-C-X2-9-C-arrangement. [2Fe-2S] clusters are sulfide-linked diiron centers, a primary role for which is electron transport.</td>

            <td id=al>pfam04324 BFD-like [2Fe-2S] binding domain. The two Fe ions are each coordinated by two conserved cysteine residues. This domain occurs alone in small proteins such as Bacterioferritin-associated ferredoxin (BFD). The function of BFD is not known, but it may may be a general redox and/or regulatory component involved in the iron storage or mobilisation functions of bacterioferritin in bacteria. This domain is also found in nitrate reductase proteins in association with Nitrite and sulphite reductase 4Fe-4S domain (pfam01077), Nitrite/Sulfite reductase ferredoxin-like half domain (pfam03460) and Pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase (pfam00070). It is also found in NifU nitrogen fixation proteins, in association with NifU-like N terminal domain (pfam01592) and NifU-like domain (pfam01106).</td>

The BFD-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain described in this family is found at the C-terminus of prokaryotic assimilatory nitrate reductase catalytic subunit (NasA) such as Rhodobacter capsulatus E1F1 NasA. Nitrate reductase catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, the first step of nitrate assimilation. R. capsulatus E1F1 nitrate reductase is composed of this NasA subunit and a small diaphorase subunit with FAD. Note that this [2Fe-2S]-binding domain is not always present; for example, it is absent from the characterized haloaechean Haloferax mediterranei NasA; both, however, have an [4Fe-4S] binding domain at their N-terminus. The BFD-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain is found in a variety of other proteins including bacterioferritin-associated ferredoxin (BFD), the large subunit of NADH-dependent nitrite reductase, and Cu+ chaperone CopZ. It comprises a helix-turn-helix fold, and binds an [2Fe-2S] cluster via 4 highly-conserved Cys residues, found in loops between the alpha-helices.

            <td id=al>cd19943 first bacterioferritin-associated ferredoxin (BFD)-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain of the large subunit of the NADH-dependent nitrite reductase. The NADH-dependent nitrite reductase (NirBD) complex comprises a large and a small subunit, and is also known as nitrite reductase (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), NADH-nitrite oxidoreductase, and assimilatory nitrite reductase. NirBD uses NADH as electron donor, and FAD, iron-sulfur cluster, and siroheme cofactors, all embedded in the large subunit NirB to catalyze the 6-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonium. NirBD plays a role in regulating nitric oxide homeostasis in Streptomyces coelicolor. In addition to NirB, the BFD-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain is found in a variety of proteins including bacterioferritin-associated ferredoxin (BFD) and Cu+ chaperone CopZ. It comprises a helix-turn-helix fold, and binds an [2Fe-2S] cluster via 4 highly-conserved Cys residues, found in loops between the alpha-helices.

This superfamily also includes uncharacterized proteins having an N-terminal BFD-like [2Fe-2S]-binding domain and a C-terminal domain belonging to the Ni,Fe-hydrogenase I small subunit family.</td>
