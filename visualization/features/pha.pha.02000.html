Ankyrin repeats are one of the most abundant repeat motifs, and generally function as scaffolds for protein-protein interactions in processes including cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, and inflammatory response. Although predominantly found in eukaryotic proteins, they are also found in some bacterial and viral proteins.  Less is known of their physiological roles in prokaryotes. Some bacterial ANK proteins play key roles in microbial pathogenesis by mimicking or manipulating host function(s). The pathogen Providencia alcalifaciens N-formyltransferase ankyrin repeats function in small molecule binding and allosteric control.

            <td id=al>cd22192 Transient Receptor Potential channel, Vanilloid subfamily (TRPV), types 5 and 6. TRPV5 and TRPV6 (TRPV5/6) are two homologous members within the vanilloid subfamily of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family. TRPV5 and TRPV6 show only 30-40% homology with other members of the TRP family and have unique properties that differentiates them from other TRP channels. They mediate calcium uptake in epithelia and their expression is dramatically increased in numerous types of cancer. The structure of TRPV5/6 shows the typical topology features of all TRP family members, such as six transmembrane regions, a short hydrophobic stretch between transmembrane segments 5 and 6, which is predicted to form the Ca2+ pore, and large intracellular N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain of TRPV5/6 contains three ankyrin repeats. This structural element is present in several proteins and plays a role in protein-protein interactions. The N- and C-terminal tails of TRPV5/6 each contain an internal PDZ motif which can function as part of a molecular scaffold via interaction with PDZ-domain containing proteins. A major difference between the properties of TRPV5 and TRPV6 is in their tissue distribution: TRPV5 is predominantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) of the kidney, with limited expression in extrarenal tissues. In contrast, TRPV6 has a broader expression pattern such as expression in the intestine, kidney, placenta, epididymis, exocrine tissues, and a few other tissues.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR00870 transient-receptor-potential calcium channel protein. The Transient Receptor Potential Ca2+ Channel (TRP-CC) Family (TC. 1.A.4)The TRP-CC family has also been called the store-operated calcium channel (SOC) family. The prototypical members include the Drosophila retinal proteinsTRP and TRPL (Montell and Rubin, 1989; Hardie and Minke, 1993). SOC members of the family mediate the entry of extracellular Ca2+ into cells in responseto depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Clapham, 1996) and agonist stimulated production of inositol-1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3). One member of the TRP-CCfamily, mammalian Htrp3, has been shown to form a tight complex with the IP3 receptor (TC #1.A.3.2.1). This interaction is apparently required for IP3 tostimulate Ca2+ release via Htrp3. The vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), which is the receptor for capsaicin (the ?hot? ingredient in chili peppers) and servesas a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway (Caterina et al., 1997), is also a member of this family. The stretch-inhibitable non-selective cation channel(SIC) is identical to the vanilloid receptor throughout all of its first 700 residues, but it exhibits a different sequence in its last 100 residues. VR1 and SICtransport monovalent cations as well as Ca2+. VR1 is about 10x more permeable to Ca2+ than to monovalent ions. Ca2+ overload probably causes cell deathafter chronic exposure to capsaicin.

            <td id=al>cd22194 Transient Receptor Potential channel, Vanilloid subfamily (TRPV), type 3. TRPV3 is a temperature-sensitive Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channel that is activated by warm temperatures, synthetic small-molecule chemicals, and natural compounds from plants. TRPV3 function is regulated by physiological factors such as extracellular divalent cations and acidic pH, intracellular adenosine triphosphate, membrane voltage, and arachidonic acid. It is expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues including epidermal keratinocytes, epithelial cells in the gut, endothelial cells in blood vessels, and neurons in dorsal root ganglia and CNS. TRPV3 null mice have abnormal hair morphogenesis and compromised skin barrier function. It may play roles in inflammatory skin disorders, such as itch and pain sensation. TRPV3 is also expressed by many neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, showing that TRPV3 might play roles in other unknown cellular and physiological functions. TRPV3 belongs to the vanilloid TRP subfamily (TRPV), named after the founding member vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1). The structure of TRPV shows the typical topology features of all TRP ion channel family members, such as six transmembrane regions, a short hydrophobic stretch between transmembrane segments 5 and 6 and large intracellular N- and C-terminal domains.</td>
