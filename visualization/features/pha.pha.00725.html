            <td id=al>C-terminal helicase domain of ATP-dependent RNA helicase. The SUV3 (suppressor of Var 3) gene encodes a DNA and RNA helicase, which is localized in mitochondria and is a subunit of the degradosome complex involved in regulation of RNA surveillance and turnover. SUV3 exhibits DNA and RNA-dependent ATPase, DNA and RNA-binding and DNA and RNA unwinding activities. SUV3 is a DEAD-like helicase belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA. This model describes the C-terminal domain, also called HelicC.</td>

Activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 3 (ASCC3) is a type II DEAD box helicase that plays a role in the repair of N-alkylated nucleotides. ASCC3 belongs to the type II DEAD box helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.</td>

            <td id=al>DEXH-box helicase domain of RIG-I. RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein), also called DEAD box protein 58 (DDX58), is a pathogen-recognition receptor that recognizes viral 5'-triphosphates carrying double-stranded RNA. Upon binding to these microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), RIG-I forms oligomers and promotes downstream processes that result in type I interferon production and induction of an antiviral state. The optimal ligand for RIG-I has been found to be base-paired or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules containing a 5' triphosphate (5'-ppp-dsRNA). RIG-I contains two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), which are required for interaction with IPS-1, a superfamily 2 helicase/translocase/ATPase (SF2) domain and a C-terminal regulatory/repressor domain (RD). RIG-I is a member of the DEAD-like helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.</td>

            <td id=al>DEXH-box helicase domain of type III restriction enzyme res subunit. Members of this cd includes both type I and type III restriction enzymes. Both are hetero-oligomeric proteins. Type I REs are encoded by three closely linked genes: a specificity subunit (HsdS or S) for recognizing a DNA sequence, a methylation subunit (HsdM or M) for methylating the recognized target bases, and a restriction subunit (HsdR or R) for the translocation and random cleavage of non-methylated DNA. They show diverse catalytic activities, including methyltransferase (MTase), ATP hydrolase (ATPase), DNA translocation and restriction activities. These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site. Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation, which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions: one containing 3-4 nucleotides, and another containing 4-5 nucleotides, separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6-8 nucleotides. Type III enzymes are composed of two subunits, Res and Mod. The Mod subunit recognizes the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification methyltransferase; as such, it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonucleases. Res is required for restriction, although it has no enzymatic activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognize short 5-6 bp-long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25-27 bp downstream to leave short, single-stranded 5' protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction to occur. These enzymes methylate only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenosyl residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction. Both type I and type III REs are members of the DEAD-like helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.</td>

            <td id=al>DEXH/Q-box helicase domain of Cas3. CRISPR-associated (Cas) 3 is a nuclease-helicase responsible for degradation of dsDNA. The two enzymatic units of Cas3, a histidine-aspartate (HD) nuclease and a Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase, may be expressed from separate genes as Cas3' (SF2 helicase) and Cas3'' (HD nuclease) or may be fused as a single HD-SF2 polypeptide. The nucleolytic activity of most Cas3 enzymes is transition metal ion-dependent. Cas3 is a member of the DEAD-like helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.</td>
