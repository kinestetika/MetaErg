            <td id=al>cd02950 TRX-like protein A (TxlA) family; TxlA was originally isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus. It is found only in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. TRX is a small enzyme that participate in redox reactions, via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol present in a CXXC motif. Disruption of the txlA gene suggests that the protein is involved in the redox regulation  of the structure and function of photosynthetic apparatus. The plant homolog (designated as HCF164) is localized in the chloroplast and is involved in the assembly of the cytochrome b6f complex, which takes a central position in photosynthetic electron transport.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02947 TRX family; composed of two groups: Group I, which includes proteins that exclusively encode a TRX domain; and Group II, which are composed of fusion proteins of TRX and additional domains. Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02953 DsbD gamma family; DsbD gamma is the C-terminal periplasmic domain of the bacterial protein DsbD. It contains a CXXC motif in a TRX fold and shuttles the reducing potential from the membrane domain (DsbD beta) to the N-terminal periplasmic domain (DsbD alpha).  DsbD beta, a transmembrane domain comprising of eight helices, acquires its reducing potential from the cytoplasmic thioredoxin. DsbD alpha transfers the acquired reducing potential from DsbD gamma to target proteins such as the periplasmic protein disulphide isomerases, DsbC and DsbG. This flow of reducing potential from the cytoplasm through DsbD allows DsbC and DsbG to act as isomerases in the oxidizing environment of the bacterial periplasm. DsbD also transfers reducing potential from the cytoplasm to specific reductases in the periplasm which are involved in the maturation of cytochromes.</td>

TlpA, ResA and DsbE are bacterial protein disulfide reductases with important roles in cytochrome maturation. They are membrane-anchored proteins with a soluble TRX domain containing a CXXC motif located in the periplasm. The TRX domains of this family contain an insert, approximately 25 residues in length, which correspond to an extra alpha helix and a beta strand when compared with TRX. TlpA catalyzes an essential reaction in the biogenesis of cytochrome aa3, while ResA and DsbE are essential proteins in cytochrome c maturation. Also included in this family are proteins containing a TlpA-like TRX domain with domain architectures similar to E. coli DipZ protein, and the N-terminal TRX domain of PilB protein from Neisseria which acts as a disulfide reductase that can recylce methionine sulfoxide reductases.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02961 Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDIa) family, redox active TRX domains; composed of eukaryotic proteins involved in oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by acting as catalysts and folding assistants. Members of this family include PDI and PDI-related proteins like ERp72, ERp57 (or ERp60), ERp44, P5, PDIR, ERp46 and the transmembrane PDIs. PDI, ERp57, ERp72, P5, PDIR and ERp46 are all oxidases, catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds of newly synthesized polypeptides in the ER. They also exhibit reductase activity in acting as isomerases to correct any non-native disulfide bonds, as well as chaperone activity to prevent protein aggregation and facilitate the folding of newly synthesized proteins. These proteins usually contain multiple copies of a redox active TRX (a) domain containing a CXXC motif, and may also contain one or more redox inactive TRX-like (b) domains. Only one a domain is required for the oxidase function but multiple copies are necessary for the isomerase function. The different types of PDIs may show different substrate specificities and tissue-specific expression, or may be induced by stress. PDIs are in their reduced form at steady state and are oxidized to the active form by Ero1, which is localized in the ER through ERp44. Some members of this family also contain a DnaJ domain in addition to the redox active a domains; examples are ERdj5 and Pfj2. Also included in the family is the redox inactive N-terminal TRX-like domain of ERp29.</td>

            <td id=al>NF038096 thylakoid membrane photosystem I accumulation factor. Members of this family, restricted to the Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, show homology to thioredoxins. However, the core region of family protein alignment shows either one Cys residue or zero, suggesting family members may share the thioredoxin-like fold but lack redox capability. The founding member of the family, slr1796, was shown by proteomics to localize to the thylakoid membrane, consistent with taxonomic restriction to the Cyanobacteria. Targeted mutation of slr1796 shows a role in successful translation and insertion of photosystem I proteins into the thylakoid membrane.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02959 Endoplasmic reticulum protein 19 (ERp19) family; ERp19 is also known as ERp18, a protein located in the ER containing one redox active TRX domain. Denaturation studies indicate that the reduced form is more stable than the oxidized form, suggesting that the protein is involved in disulfide bond formation. In vitro, ERp19 has been shown to possess thiol-disulfide oxidase activity which is dependent on the presence of both active site cysteines. Although described as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)-like, the protein does not complement for PDI activity. ERp19 shows a wide tissue distribution but is most abundant in liver, testis, heart and kidney.</td>

PICOT contains an N-terminal TRX-like domain, which does not contain the catalytic CXXC motif, followed by one to three glutaredoxin domains. The TRX-like domain is required for interaction with PKC theta. PICOT inhibits the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-kB, induced by PKC theta or T-cell activating stimuli.</td>
