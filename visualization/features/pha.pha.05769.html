            <td id=al>cd01743 Type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1) domain found in Anthranilate synthase. Type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1) domain found in Anthranilate synthase (ASase). This group contains proteins similar to para-aminobenzoate (PABA) synthase and ASase.  These enzymes catalyze similar reactions and produce similar products, PABA and ortho-aminobenzoate (anthranilate). Each enzyme is composed of non-identical subunits: a glutamine amidotransferase subunit (component II) and a subunit that produces an aminobenzoate products (component I). ASase catalyses the synthesis of anthranilate from chorismate and glutamine and is a tetrameric protein comprising two copies each of components I and II. Component II of ASase belongs to the family of triad GTases which hydrolyze glutamine and transfer nascent ammonia between the active sites. In some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, component II can be much larger than in other organisms, due to the presence of phosphoribosyl-anthranilate transferase (PRTase) activity. PRTase catalyses the second step in tryptophan biosynthesis and results in the addition of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to anthranilate to create N-5'-phosphoribosyl-anthranilate.  In E.coli, the first step in the conversion of chorismate to PABA involves two proteins: PabA and PabB which co-operate to transfer the amide nitrogen of glutamine to chorismate forming 4-amino-4 deoxychorismate (ADC). PabA acts as a glutamine amidotransferase, supplying an amino group to PabB, which carries out the amination reaction. A third protein PabC then mediates elimination of pyruvate and aromatization to give PABA. Several organisms have bipartite proteins containing fused domains homologous to PabA and PabB commonly called PABA synthases. These hybrid PABA synthases may produce ADC and not PABA.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01744 Small chain of the glutamine-dependent form of carbamoyl phosphate synthase, CPSase II. This group of sequences represents the small chain of the glutamine-dependent form of carbamoyl phosphate synthase, CPSase II.  CPSase II catalyzes the production of carbomyl phosphate (CP) from bicarbonate, glutamine and two molecules of MgATP. The reaction is believed to proceed by a series of four biochemical reactions involving a minimum of three discrete highly reactive intermediates. The synthesis of CP is critical for the initiation of two separate biosynthetic pathways. In one CP is coupled to aspartate, its carbon and nitrogen nuclei ultimately incorporated into the aromatic moieties of pyrimidine nucleotides. In the second pathway CP is condensed with ornithine at the start of the urea cycle and is utilized for the detoxification of ammonia and biosynthesis of arginine. CPSases may be encoded by one or by several genes, depending on the species.  The E.coli enzyme is a heterodimer consisting of two polypeptide chains referred to as the small and large subunit. Ammonia an intermediate during the biosynthesis of carbomyl phosphate produced by the hydrolysis of glutamine in the small subunit of the enzyme is delivered via a molecular tunnel between the remotely located carboxyphosphate active site in the large subunit. CPSase IIs belong to the triad family of amidotransferases having a conserved Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad in the glutaminase active site. This group also contains the sequence from the mammalian urea cycle form which has lost the active site Cys, resulting in an ammonia-dependent form, CPSase I.</td>

This group includes proteins similar to Class I glutamine amidotransferases, the intracellular PH1704 from Pyrococcus horikoshii, the C-terminal of the large catalase: Escherichia coli HP-II, Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 ThuA. and, the A4 beta-galactosidase middle domain.  The majority of proteins in this group have a reactive Cys found in the sharp turn between a beta strand and an alpha helix termed the nucleophile elbow.  For Class I glutamine amidotransferases proteins which transfer ammonia from the amide side chain of glutamine to an acceptor substrate, this Cys forms a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad in the active site.  Glutamine amidotransferases activity can be found in a range of biosynthetic enzymes included in this cd: glutamine amidotransferase, formylglycinamide ribonucleotide, GMP synthetase, anthranilate synthase component II, glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthase, cytidine triphosphate synthetase, gamma-glutamyl hydrolase, imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase and, cobyric acid synthase. For Pyrococcus horikoshii PH1704, the Cys of the nucleophile elbow together with a different His and, a Glu from an adjacent monomer form a catalytic triad different from the typical GATase1 triad. The E. coli HP-II C-terminal domain, S.  meliloti Rm1021 ThuA and the A4 beta-galactosidase middle domain lack the catalytic triad typical GATaseI domains. GATase1-like domains can occur either as single polypeptides, as in Class I glutamine amidotransferases, or as domains in a much larger multifunctional synthase protein, such as CPSase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01741 Subgroup of proteins having the Type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1) domain. This group contains a subgroup of proteins having the Type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1) domain. GATase activity catalyses the transfer of ammonia from the amide side chain of glutamine to an acceptor substrate. Glutamine amidotransferases (GATase) includes the triad family of amidotransferases which have a conserved Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad in the glutaminase active site. In this subgroup this triad is conserved. GATase activity can be found in a range of biosynthetic enzymes, including: glutamine amidotransferase, formylglycinamide ribonucleotide, GMP synthetase , anthranilate synthase component II, glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthase, cytidine triphosphate synthetase, gamma-glutamyl hydrolase, imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase and, cobyric acid synthase. Glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) domains can occur either as single polypeptides, as in glutamine amidotransferases, or as domains in a much larger multifunctional synthase protein, such as CPSase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03128 Type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1)-like domain. Type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1)-like domain. This group contains proteins similar to Class I glutamine amidotransferases, the intracellular PH1704 from Pyrococcus horikoshii, the C-terminal of the large catalase: Escherichia coli HP-II, Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 ThuA, the A4 beta-galactosidase middle domain and peptidase E.  The majority of proteins in this group have a reactive Cys found in the sharp turn between a beta strand and an alpha helix termed the nucleophile elbow.  For Class I glutamine amidotransferases proteins which transfer ammonia from the amide side chain of glutamine to an acceptor substrate, this Cys forms a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad in the active site.  Glutamine amidotransferases activity can be found in a range of biosynthetic enzymes included in this cd: glutamine amidotransferase, formylglycinamide ribonucleotide, GMP synthetase, anthranilate synthase component II, glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthase (CPSase), cytidine triphosphate synthetase, gamma-glutamyl hydrolase, imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase and, cobyric acid synthase. For Pyrococcus horikoshii PH1704, the Cys of the nucleophile elbow together with a different His and, a Glu from an adjacent monomer form a catalytic triad different from the typical GATase1 triad. Peptidase E is believed to be a serine peptidase having a Ser-His-Glu catalytic triad which differs from the Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad of typical GATase1 domains, by having a Ser in place of the reactive Cys at the nucleophile elbow. The E. coli HP-II C-terminal domain, S. meliloti Rm1021 ThuA and the A4 beta-galactosidase middle domain lack the catalytic triad typical GATaseI domains. GATase1-like domains can occur either as single polypeptides, as in Class I glutamine amidotransferases, or as domains in a much larger multifunctional synthase protein, such as CPSase. Peptidase E has a circular permutation in the common core of a typical GTAse1 domain.</td>
