            <td id=al>Ras-related in brain (Rab) family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Rab GTPases form the largest family within the Ras superfamily. There are at least 60 Rab genes in the human genome, and a number of Rab GTPases are conserved from yeast to humans. Rab GTPases are small, monomeric proteins that function as molecular switches to regulate vesicle trafficking pathways. The different Rab GTPases are localized to the cytosolic face of specific intracellular membranes, where they regulate distinct steps in membrane traffic pathways. In the GTP-bound form, Rab GTPases recruit specific sets of effector proteins onto membranes. Through their effectors, Rab GTPases regulate vesicle formation, actin- and tubulin-dependent vesicle movement, and membrane fusion. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which mask C-terminal lipid binding and promote cytosolic localization. While most unicellular organisms possess 5-20 Rab members, several have been found to possess 60 or more Rabs; for many of these Rab isoforms, homologous proteins are not found in other organisms. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C-terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins. Since crystal structures often lack C-terminal residues, the lipid modification site is not available for annotation in many of the CDs in the hierarchy, but is included where possible.</td>

            <td id=al>Rab GTPase family 6 (Rab6). Rab6 is involved in microtubule-dependent transport pathways through the Golgi and from endosomes to the Golgi. Rab6A of mammals is implicated in retrograde transport through the Golgi stack, and is also required for a slow, COPI-independent, retrograde transport pathway from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway may allow Golgi residents to be recycled through the ER for scrutiny by ER quality-control systems. Yeast Ypt6p, the homolog of the mammalian Rab6 GTPase, is not essential for cell viability. Ypt6p acts in endosome-to-Golgi, in intra-Golgi retrograde transport, and possibly also in Golgi-to-ER trafficking. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization.

The Rab5-related subfamily includes Rab5 and Rab22 of mammals, Ypt51/Ypt52/Ypt53 of yeast, and RabF of plants. The members of this subfamily are involved in endocytosis and endocytic-sorting pathways. In mammals, Rab5 GTPases localize to early endosomes and regulate fusion of clathrin-coated vesicles to early endosomes and fusion between early endosomes. In yeast, Ypt51p family members similarly regulate membrane trafficking through prevacuolar compartments.

Rab21 has been reported to localize in the ER in human intestinal epithelial cells, with partial colocalization with alpha-glucosidase, a late endosomal/lysosomal marker. More recently, Rab21 was shown to colocalize with and affect the morphology of early endosomes. In Dictyostelium, GTP-bound Rab21, together with two novel LIM domain proteins, LimF and ChLim, has been shown to regulate phagocytosis.

            <td id=al>Rab GTPase family 4 (Rab4). Rab4 subfamily. Rab4 has been implicated in numerous functions within the cell. It helps regulate endocytosis through the sorting, recycling, and degradation of early endosomes. Mammalian Rab4 is involved in the regulation of many surface proteins including G-protein-coupled receptors, transferrin receptor, integrins, and surfactant protein A. Experimental data implicate Rab4 in regulation of the recycling of internalized receptors back to the plasma membrane. It is also believed to influence receptor-mediated antigen processing in B-lymphocytes, in calcium-dependent exocytosis in platelets, in alpha-amylase secretion in pancreatic cells, and in insulin-induced translocation of Glut4 from internal vesicles to the cell surface. Rab4 is known to share effector proteins with Rab5 and Rab11. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state.

However, trypanosomal Rab, TbRAB18, is upregulated in the BSF (Blood Stream Form) stage and localized predominantly to elements of the Golgi complex. In human and mouse cells, Rab18 has been identified in lipid droplets, organelles that store neutral lipids.

            <td id=al>Rab GTPase family 14 (Rab14). Rab14 GTPases are localized to biosynthetic compartments, including the rough ER, the Golgi complex, and the trans-Golgi network, and to endosomal compartments, including early endosomal vacuoles and associated vesicles. Rab14 is believed to function in both the biosynthetic and recycling pathways between the Golgi and endosomal compartments. Rab14 has also been identified on GLUT4 vesicles, and has been suggested to help regulate GLUT4 translocation. In addition, Rab14 is believed to play a role in the regulation of phagocytosis. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state.

            <td id=al>Rab GTPase family 11 (Rab11)-like includes Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25. Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25 are closely related, evolutionary conserved Rab proteins that are differentially expressed. Rab11a is ubiquitously synthesized, Rab11b is enriched in brain and heart and Rab25 is only found in epithelia. Rab11/25 proteins seem to regulate recycling pathways from endosomes to the plasma membrane and to the trans-Golgi network. Furthermore, Rab11a is thought to function in the histamine-induced fusion of tubulovesicles containing H+, K+ ATPase with the plasma membrane in gastric parietal cells and in insulin-stimulated insertion of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of Rab25 has recently been observed in ovarian cancer and breast cancer, and has been correlated with worsened outcomes in both diseases. In addition, Rab25 overexpression has also been observed in prostate cancer, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and invasive breast tumor cells. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state.

It is likely that these Rabs have functions that are specific to the mammalian lineage and have no orthologs in plants. Rab8 modulates polarized membrane transport through reorganization of actin and microtubules, induces the formation of new surface extensions, and has an important role in directed membrane transport to cell surfaces. The Ypt2 gene of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes a member of the Ypt/Rab family of small GTP-binding proteins, related in sequence to Sec4p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae but closer to mammalian Rab8.

Studies on mutations of Ypt1, the yeast homolog of Rab1, showed that this protein is necessary for the budding of vesicles of the ER as well as for their transport to, and fusion with, the Golgi apparatus. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization. Most Rab GTPases contain a lipid modification site at the C-terminus, with sequence motifs CC, CXC, or CCX. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rab proteins.

First identified in maize, Rab28 has been shown to be a late embryogenesis-abundant (Lea) protein that is regulated by the plant hormone abcisic acid (ABA). In Arabidopsis, Rab28 is expressed during embryo development and is generally restricted to provascular tissues in mature embryos. Unlike maize Rab28, it is not ABA-inducible. Characterization of the human Rab28 homolog revealed two isoforms, which differ by a 95-base pair insertion, producing an alternative sequence for the 30 amino acids at the C-terminus. The two human isoforms are presumably the result of alternative splicing. Since they differ at the C-terminus but not in the GTP-binding region, they are predicted to be targeted to different cellular locations. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP.

This superfamily also includes proteins like the GTP translation factors, Era-like GTPases, and G-alpha chain of the heterotrimeric G proteins. Members of the Ras superfamily regulate a wide variety of cellular functions: the Ras family regulates gene expression, the Rho family regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression, the Rab and Sar1/Arf families regulate vesicle trafficking, and the Ran family regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport and microtubule organization. The GTP translation factor family regulates initiation, elongation, termination, and release in translation, and the Era-like GTPase family regulates cell division, sporulation, and DNA replication. Members of the Ras superfamily are identified by the GTP binding site, which is made up of five characteristic sequence motifs, and the switch I and switch II regions.</td>

This enables its participation in microtubular dynenin-dynactin-mediated repositioning of lysosomes from the cell periphery to the Golgi. A Rab34 (Rah) isoform that lacks the consensus GTP-binding region has been identified in mice. This isoform is associated with membrane ruffles and promotes macropinosome formation. Rab36 has been mapped to human chromosome 22q11.2, a region that is homozygously deleted in malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs). However, experimental assessments do not implicate Rab36 as a tumor suppressor that would enable tumor formation through a loss-of-function mechanism.

Unlike most Rab proteins whose functions remain poorly defined, Rab27a has many known functions. Rab27a has multiple effector proteins, and depending on which effector it binds, Rab27a has different functions as well as tissue distribution and/or cellular localization. Putative functions have been assigned to Rab27a when associated with the effector proteins Slp1, Slp2, Slp3, Slp4, Slp5, DmSlp, rabphilin, Dm/Ce-rabphilin, Slac2-a, Slac2-b, Slac2-c, Noc2, JFC1, and Munc13-4. Rab27a has been associated with several human diseases, including hemophagocytic syndrome (Griscelli syndrome or GS), Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and choroidermia. In the case of GS, a rare, autosomal recessive disease, a Rab27a mutation is directly responsible for the disorder. When Rab27a is localized to the secretory granules of pancreatic beta cells, it is believed to mediate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, making it a potential target for diabetes therapy. When bound to JFC1 in prostate cells, Rab27a is believed to regulate the exocytosis of prostate- specific markers.

The specific function of Rab24 still remains unknown. It is found in a transport route between ER-cis-Golgi and late endocytic compartments. It is putatively involved in an autophagic pathway, possibly directing misfolded proteins in the ER to degradative pathways.

Rab23 mediates the activity of Gli2 and Gli3, transcription factors that regulate Shh signaling in the spinal cord, primarily by preventing Gli2 activation in the absence of Shh ligand. Rab23 also regulates a step in the cytoplasmic signal transduction pathway that mediates the effect of Smoothened (one of two integral membrane proteins that are essential components of the Shh signaling pathway in vertebrates). In humans, Rab23 is expressed in the retina. Mice contain an isoform that shares 93% sequence identity with the human Rab23 and an alternative splicing isoform that is specific to the brain. This isoform causes the murine open brain phenotype, indicating it may have a role in the development of the central nervous system.

Rab3A, Rab3B, and Rab3C localized to synaptic and secretory vesicles; Rab3D was expressed at high levels only in adipose tissue, exocrine glands, and the endocrine pituitary, where it is localized to cytoplasmic secretory granules. Rab3 appears to control Ca2+-regulated exocytosis. The appropriate GDP/GTP exchange cycle of Rab3A is required for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis to occur, and interaction of the GTP-bound form of Rab3A with effector molecule(s) is widely believed to be essential for this process.

Spg1p is an essential gene that localizes to the spindle pole bodies. When GTP-bound, it binds cdc7 and causes it to translocate to spindle poles. Sid4p (septation initiation defective) is required for localization of Spg1p to the spindle pole body, and the ability of Spg1p to promote septum formation from any point in the cell cycle depends on Sid4p. Spg1p is negatively regulated by Byr4 and cdc16, which form a two-component GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Spg1p. The existence of a SIN-related pathway in plants has been proposed.

The Ras family of the Ras superfamily includes classical N-Ras, H-Ras, and K-Ras, as well as R-Ras, Rap, Ral, Rheb, Rhes, ARHI, RERG, Rin/Rit, RSR1, RRP22, Ras2, Ras-dva, and RGK proteins. Ras proteins regulate cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Ras is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that release GDP and allow GTP binding. Many RasGEFs have been identified. These are sequestered in the cytosol until activation by growth factors triggers recruitment to the plasma membrane or Golgi, where the GEF colocalizes with Ras. Active GTP-bound Ras interacts with several effector proteins: among the best characterized are the Raf kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), RalGEFs and NORE/MST1. Most Ras proteins contain a lipid modification site at the C-terminus, with a typical sequence motif CaaX, where a = an aliphatic amino acid and X = any amino acid. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Ras proteins. Due to the presence of truncated sequences in this CD, the lipid modification site is not available for annotation.</td>

            <td id=al>Rab GTPase-like family 2 (Rab-like2). RabL2 (Rab-like2) subfamily. RabL2s are novel Rab proteins identified recently which display features that are distinct from other Rabs, and have been termed Rab-like. RabL2 contains RabL2a and RabL2b, two very similar Rab proteins that share > 98% sequence identity in humans. RabL2b maps to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 22q13.3 and RabL2a maps to 2q13, a region that suggests it is also a subtelomeric gene. Both genes are believed to be expressed ubiquitously, suggesting that RabL2s are the first example of duplicated genes in human proximal subtelomeric regions that are both expressed actively. Like other Rab-like proteins, RabL2s lack a prenylation site at the C-terminus. The specific functions of RabL2a and RabL2b remain unknown. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) interact with GTP-bound Rab and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with GDP-bound Rabs to promote the formation of the GTP-bound state. Rabs are further regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which facilitate Rab recycling by masking C-terminal lipid binding and promoting cytosolic localization.</td>

            <td id=al>ADP-ribosylation factor(Arf)/Arf-like (Arl) small GTPases. Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor)/Arl (Arf-like) small GTPases. Arf proteins are activators of phospholipase D isoforms. Unlike Ras proteins they lack cysteine residues at their C-termini and therefore are unlikely to be prenylated. Arfs are N-terminally myristoylated. Members of the Arf family are regulators of vesicle formation in intracellular traffic that interact reversibly with membranes of the secretory and endocytic compartments in a GTP-dependent manner. They depart from other small GTP-binding proteins by a unique structural device, interswitch toggle, that implements front-back communication from N-terminus to the nucleotide binding site. Arf-like (Arl) proteins are close relatives of the Arf, but only Arl1 has been shown to function in membrane traffic like the Arf proteins. Arl2 has an unrelated function in the folding of native tubulin, and Arl4 may function in the nucleus. Most other Arf family proteins are so far relatively poorly characterized. Thus, despite their significant sequence homologies, Arf family proteins may regulate unrelated functions.</td>

            <td id=al>Ras-related nuclear proteins (Ran)/TC4 family of small GTPases. Ran GTPase is involved in diverse biological functions, such as nuclear transport, spindle formation during mitosis, DNA replication, and cell division. Among the Ras superfamily, Ran is a unique small G protein. It does not have a lipid modification motif at the C-terminus to bind to the membrane, which is often observed within the Ras superfamily. Ran may therefore interact with a wide range of proteins in various intracellular locations. Like other GTPases, Ran exists in GTP- and GDP-bound conformations that interact differently with effectors. Conversion between these forms and the assembly or disassembly of effector complexes requires the interaction of regulator proteins. The intrinsic GTPase activity of Ran is very low, but it is greatly stimulated by a GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1) located in the cytoplasm. By contrast, RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that generates RanGTP, is bound to chromatin and confined to the nucleus. Ran itself is mobile and is actively imported into the nucleus by a mechanism involving NTF-2. Together with the compartmentalization of its regulators, this is thought to produce a relatively high concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus.</td>

Their functions are diverse; in Dictyostelium discoideum, which encodes 11 Roco proteins, they are involved in cell division, chemotaxis and development, while in human, where 4 Roco proteins (LRRK1, LRRK2, DAPK1, and MFHAS1) are encoded, these proteins are involved in epilepsy and cancer.

Rab9 has been identified as a key component for the replication of several viruses, including HIV1, Ebola, Marburg, and measles, making it a potential target for inhibiting a variety of viruses.

            <td id=al>Ras homology family 4 (Rho4) of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)-like. Rho4 is a GTPase that controls septum degradation by regulating secretion of Eng1 or Agn1 during cytokinesis. Rho4 also plays a role in cell morphogenesis. Rho4 regulates septation and cell morphology by controlling the actin cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic microtubules. The localization of Rho4 is modulated by Rdi1, which may function as a GDI, and by Rga9, which is believed to function as a GAP. In S. pombe, both Rho4 deletion and Rho4 overexpression result in a defective cell wall, suggesting a role for Rho4 in maintaining cell wall integrity. Most Rho proteins contain a lipid modification site at the C-terminus, with a typical sequence motif CaaX, where a = an aliphatic amino acid and X = any amino acid.

            <td id=al>Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain (RheB) is a small GTPase. Rheb (Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain) subfamily. Rheb was initially identified in rat brain, where its expression is elevated by seizures or by long-term potentiation. It is expressed ubiquitously, with elevated levels in muscle and brain. Rheb functions as an important mediator between the tuberous sclerosis complex proteins, TSC1 and TSC2, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase to stimulate cell growth. TOR kinase regulates cell growth by controlling nutrient availability, growth factors, and the energy status of the cell. TSC1 and TSC2 form a dimeric complex that has tumor suppressor activity, and TSC2 is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Rheb. The TSC1/TSC2 complex inhibits the activation of TOR kinase through Rheb. Rheb has also been shown to induce the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in a process that is dependent on the GTPase cycle of Rheb, but independent of the TOR kinase, suggesting Rheb plays a role in endocytic trafficking that leads to cell growth and cell-cycle progression. Most Ras proteins contain a lipid modification site at the C-terminus, with a typical sequence motif CaaX, where a = an aliphatic amino acid and X = any amino acid.

            <td id=al>Ral (Ras-like) family containing highly homologous RalA and RalB. The Ral (Ras-like) subfamily consists of the highly homologous RalA and RalB. Ral proteins are believed to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis, metastasis, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Despite their high sequence similarity (>80% sequence identity), nonoverlapping and opposing functions have been assigned to RalA and RalBs in tumor migration. In human bladder and prostate cancer cells, RalB promotes migration while RalA inhibits it. A Ral-specific set of GEFs has been identified that are activated by Ras binding. This RalGEF activity is enhanced by Ras binding to another of its target proteins, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Ral effectors include RLIP76/RalBP1, a Rac/cdc42 GAP, and the exocyst (Sec6/8) complex, a heterooctomeric protein complex that is involved in tethering vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane prior to exocytosis. In rat kidney cells, RalB is required for functional assembly of the exocyst and for localizing the exocyst to the leading edge of migrating cells. In human cancer cells, RalA is required to support anchorage-independent proliferation and RalB is required to suppress apoptosis. RalA has been shown to localize to the plasma membrane while RalB is localized to the intracellular vesicles. Most Ras proteins contain a lipid modification site at the C-terminus, with a typical sequence motif CaaX, where a = an aliphatic amino acid and X = any amino acid. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Ras proteins.

            <td id=al>Rap-like family consists of Rap1, Rap2 and RSR1. The Rap subfamily consists of the Rap1, Rap2, and RSR1. Rap subfamily proteins perform different cellular functions, depending on the isoform and its subcellular localization. For example, in rat salivary gland, neutrophils, and platelets, Rap1 localizes to secretory granules and is believed to regulate exocytosis or the formation of secretory granules. Rap1 has also been shown to localize in the Golgi of rat fibroblasts, zymogen granules, plasma membrane, and microsomal membrane of the pancreatic acini, as well as in the endocytic compartment of skeletal muscle cells and fibroblasts. Rap1 localizes in the nucleus of human oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and cell lines. Rap1 plays a role in phagocytosis by controlling the binding of adhesion receptors (typically integrins) to their ligands. In yeast, Rap1 has been implicated in multiple functions, including activation and silencing of transcription and maintenance of telomeres. Rap2 is involved in multiple functions, including activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in embryonic Xenopus. A number of effector proteins for Rap2 have been identified, including isoform 3 of the human mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) and Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK), and the RalGEFs RalGDS, RGL, and Rlf, which also interact with Rap1 and Ras. RSR1 is the fungal homolog of Rap1 and Rap2. In budding yeasts, it is involved in selecting a site for bud growth, which directs the establishment of cell polarization. The Rho family GTPase Cdc42 and its GEF, Cdc24, then establish an axis of polarized growth. It is believed that Cdc42 interacts directly with RSR1 in vivo. In filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii, RSR1 is a key regulator of polar growth in the hypha. Most Ras proteins contain a lipid modification site at the C-terminus, with a typical sequence motif CaaX, where a = an aliphatic amino acid and X = any amino acid. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Ras proteins. Due to the presence of truncated sequences in this CD, the lipid modification site is not available for annotation.</td>
