            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of bacterial Serine/Threonine kinases, PknB and similar proteins. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily includes many bacterial eukaryotic-type STKs including Staphylococcus aureus PknB (also called PrkC or Stk1), Bacillus subtilis PrkC, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pkn proteins (PknB, PknD, PknE, PknF, PknL, and PknH), among others. S. aureus PknB is the only eukaryotic-type STK present in this species, although many microorganisms encode for several such proteins. It is important for the survival and pathogenesis of S. aureus as it is involved in the regulation of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, autolysis, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. M. tuberculosis PknB is essential for growth and it acts on diverse substrates including proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, cell division, transcription, stress responses, and metabolic regulation. B. subtilis PrkC is located at the inner membrane of endospores and functions to trigger spore germination. Bacterial STKs in this subfamily show varied domain architectures. The well-characterized members such as S. aureus and M. tuberculosis PknB, and B. subtilis PrkC, contain an N-terminal cytosolic  kinase domain, a transmembrane (TM) segment, and mutliple C-terminal extracellular PASTA domains. The PknB subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

The WD40 repeat is found in a number of eukaryotic proteins that cover a wide variety of functions including adaptor/regulatory modules in signal transduction, pre-mRNA processing, and cytoskeleton assembly. It typically contains a GH dipeptide 11-24 residues from its N-terminus and the WD dipeptide at its C-terminus and is 40 residues long, hence the name WD40. Between the GH and WD dipeptides lies a conserved core. It forms a propeller-like structure with several blades where each blade is composed of a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. The WD40 sequence repeat originally described in literature forms the first three strands of one blade and the last strand in the next blade. The C-terminal WD40 repeat completes the blade structure of the N-terminal WD40 repeat to create the closed ring propeller-structure. The residues on the top and bottom surface of the propeller are proposed to coordinate interactions with other proteins and/or small ligands, allowing them to bind either stably or reversibly.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of Protein Kinases. PKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine or tyrosine residues on protein substrates. PKs make up a large family of serine/threonine kinases (STKs), protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), and dual-specificity PKs that phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues of target proteins. Majority of protein phosphorylation occurs on serine residues while only 1% occurs on tyrosine residues. Protein phosphorylation is a mechanism by which a wide variety of cellular proteins, such as enzymes and membrane channels, are reversibly regulated in response to certain stimuli. PKs often function as components of signal transduction pathways in which one kinase activates a second kinase, which in turn, may act on other kinases; this sequential action transmits a signal from the cell surface to target proteins, which results in cellular responses. The PK family is one of the largest known protein families with more than 100 homologous yeast enzymes and more than 500 human proteins. A fraction of PK family members are pseudokinases that lack crucial residues for catalytic activity. The mutiplicity of kinases allows for specific regulation according to substrate, tissue distribution, and cellular localization.

AGC kinases share an activation mechanism based on the phosphorylation of up to three sites: the activation loop (A-loop), the hydrophobic motif (HM) and the turn motif. Phosphorylation at the A-loop is required of most AGC kinases, which results in a disorder-to-order transition of the A-loop. The ordered conformation results in the access of substrates and ATP to the active site. A subset of AGC kinases with C-terminal extensions containing the HM also requires phosphorylation at this site. Phosphorylation at the HM allows the C-terminal extension to form an ordered structure that packs into the hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic domain, which then reconfigures the kinase into an active bi-lobed state.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. IRAKs are involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) signalling pathways, and are thus critical in regulating innate immune responses and inflammation. Some IRAKs may also play roles in T- and B-cell signaling, and adaptive immunity. Vertebrates contain four IRAKs (IRAK-1, -2, -3 (or -M), and -4) that display distinct functions and patterns of expression and subcellular distribution, and can differentially mediate TLR signaling. IRAK-1, -2, and -4 are ubiquitously expressed and are active kinases, while IRAK-M is only induced in monocytes and macrophages and is an inactive kinase. Variations in IRAK genes are linked to diverse diseases including infection, sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. IRAKs contain an N-terminal Death domain (DD), a proST region (rich in serines, prolines, and threonines), a central kinase domain (a pseudokinase domain in the case of IRAK3), and a C-terminal domain; IRAK-4 lacks the C-terminal domain. This subfamily includes plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including Arabidopsis thaliana BAK1 and CLAVATA1 (CLV1). BAK1 functions in BR (brassinosteroid)-regulated plant development and in pathways involved in plant resistance to pathogen infection and herbivore attack.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Aurora kinases are key regulators of mitosis and are essential for the accurate and equal division of genomic material from parent to daughter cells. Yeast contains only one Aurora kinase while most higher eukaryotes have two. Vertebrates contain at least 2 Aurora kinases (A and B); mammals contains a third Aurora kinase gene (C). Aurora-A regulates cell cycle events from the late S-phase through the M-phase including centrosome maturation, mitotic entry, centrosome separation, spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, cytokinesis, and mitotic exit. Aurora-A activation depends on its autophosphorylation  and binding to the microtubule-associated protein TPX2. Aurora-B is most active at the transition during metaphase to the end of mitosis. It is critical for accurate chromosomal segregation, cytokinesis, protein localization to the centrosome and kinetochore, correct microtubule-kinetochore attachments, and regulation of the mitotic checkpoint. Aurora-C is mainly expressed in meiotically dividing cells; it was originally discovered in mice as a testis-specific STK called Aie1.

Dual-specificity PKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine (S/T) as well as tyrosine residues on protein substrates. CLKs are involved in the phosphorylation and regulation of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which play a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing by directing splice site selection. SR proteins are phosphorylated first by SR protein kinases (SRPKs) at the N-terminus, which leads to its assembly into nuclear speckles where splicing factors are stored. CLKs phosphorylate the C-terminal part of SR proteins, causing the nuclear speckles to dissolve and splicing factors to be recruited at sites of active transcription. Based on a conserved "EHLAMMERILG" signature motif which may be crucial for substrate specificity, CLKs are also referred to as LAMMER kinases. CLKs autophosphorylate at tyrosine residues and phosphorylate their substrates exclusively on S/T residues. In Drosophila, the CLK homolog DOA (Darkener of apricot) is essential for embryogenesis and its mutation leads to defects in sexual differentiation, eye formation, and neuronal development. In fission yeast, the CLK homolog Lkh1 is a negative regulator of filamentous growth and asexual flocculation, and is also involved in oxidative stress response. Vertebrates contain mutliple CLK proteins and mammals have four (CLK1-4).

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. PASK (or PASKIN) is a nutrient and energy sensor and thus, plays an important role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. It coordinates the utilization of glucose in response to metabolic demand. It contains an N-terminal PAS domain which directly interacts and inhibits a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain. The PAS domain serves as a sensory module for different environmental signals such as light, redox state, and various metabolites. Binding of ligands to the PAS domain causes structural changes which leads to kinase activation and the phosphorylation of substrates to trigger the appropriate cellular response.

Dictyostelium discoideum MEK1 is required for proper chemotaxis; MEK1 null mutants display severe defects in cell polarization and directional movement. Plants contain multiple MAPKKs like other eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis genome encodes for 10 MAPKKs while poplar and rice contain 13 MAPKKs each. The functions of these proteins have not been fully elucidated. There is evidence to suggest that MAPK cascades are involved in plant stress responses.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. PLKs play important roles in cell cycle progression and in DNA damage responses. They regulate mitotic entry, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis. In general PLKs contain an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory polo box domain (PBD), which is comprised by two bipartite polo-box motifs (or polo boxes) and is involved in protein interactions. PLKs derive their names from homology to polo, a kinase first identified in Drosophila. There are five mammalian PLKs (PLK1-5) from distinct genes. There is good evidence that PLK1 may function as an oncogene while PLK2-5 have tumor suppressive properties. PLK1 functions as a positive regulator of mitosis, meiosis, and cytokinesis. PLK2 functions in G1 progression, S-phase arrest, and centriole duplication. PLK3 regulates angiogenesis and responses to DNA damage. PLK4 is required for late mitotic progression, cell survival, and embryonic development.

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine kinases, Unc-51-like kinases 1 and 2, and similar proteins. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. The ATG1/ULK complex is conserved from yeast to humans and it plays a critical role in the initiation of autophagy, the intracellular system that leads to the lysosomal degradation of cellular components and their recycling into basic metabolic units. ULK1 is required for efficient amino acid starvation-induced autophagy and mitochondrial clearance. ULK2 is ubiquitously expressed and is essential in autophagy induction. ULK1 and ULK2 have unique and cell-type specific roles, but also display partially redundant roles in starvation-induced autophagy. They both display neuron-specific functions: ULK1 is involved in non-clathrin-coated endocytosis in growth cones, filopodia extension, and axon branching; ULK2 plays a role in axon development. The ULK1/2 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

This subfamily contains c-ros, Sevenless, and similar proteins. The proto-oncogene c-ros encodes an orphan receptor PTK (RTK) with an unknown ligand. RTKs contain an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular tyr kinase domain. RTKs are usually activated through ligand binding, which causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyr kinase catalytic domain. C-ros is expressed in embryonic cells of the kidney, intestine and lung, but disappears soon after birth. It persists only in the adult epididymis. Male mice bearing inactive mutations of c-ros lack the initial segment of the epididymis and are infertile. The Drosophila protein, Sevenless, is required for the specification of the R7 photoreceptor cell during eye development.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. NUAK proteins are classified as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related kinases, which like AMPK are activated by the major tumor suppressor LKB1. Vertebrates contain two NUAK proteins, called NUAK1 and NUAK2. NUAK2, also called SNARK (Sucrose, non-fermenting 1/AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinase), is involved in energy metabolism. It is activated by hyperosmotic stress, DNA damage, and nutrients such as glucose and glutamine. NUAK2-knockout mice develop obesity, altered serum lipid profiles, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. NUAK2 is implicated in regulating actin stress fiber assembly through its association with myosin phosphatase Rho-interacting protein (MRIP), which leads to an increase in myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. It is also associated with tumor growth, migration, and oncogenicity of melanoma cells.

DCKL (or DCAMKL) proteins belong to the doublecortin (DCX) family of proteins which are involved in neuronal migration, neurogenesis, and eye receptor development, among others. Family members typically contain tandem doublecortin (DCX) domains at the N-terminus; DCX domains can bind microtubules and serve as protein-interaction platforms. In addition, DCKL proteins contain a C-terminal kinase domain with similarity to CAMKs. They are involved in the regulation of cAMP signaling. Vertebrates contain three DCKL proteins (DCKL1-3); DCKL1 and 2 also contain a serine, threonine, and proline rich domain (SP), while DCKL3 contains only a single DCX domain instead of tandem domains.

Activated MAP3K8 induces various MAPK pathways including Extracellular Regulated Kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. It plays a pivotal role in innate immunity, linking Toll-like receptors to the production of TNF and the activation of ERK in macrophages. It is also required in interleukin-1beta production and is critical in host defense against Gram-positive bacteria. MAP3Ks (MKKKs or MAPKKKs) phosphorylate and activate MAPK kinases (MAPKKs or MKKs or MAP2Ks), which in turn phosphorylate and activate MAPKs during signaling cascades that are important in mediating cellular responses to extracellular signals.

They are receptor PTKs (RTKs) containing an extracellular EGF-related ligand-binding region, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic region with a tyr kinase domain and a regulatory C-terminal tail. Unlike other PTKs, phosphorylation of the activation loop of EGFR proteins is not critical to their activation. Instead, they are activated by ligand-induced dimerization, resulting in the phosphorylation of tyr residues in the C-terminal tail, which serve as binding sites for downstream signaling molecules. Collectively, they can recognize a variety of ligands including EGF, TGFalpha, and neuregulins, among others. All four subfamily members can form homo- or heterodimers. HER3 contains an impaired kinase domain and depends on its heterodimerization partner for activation. EGFR subfamily members are involved in signaling pathways leading to a broad range of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. Gain of function alterations, through their overexpression, deletions, or point mutations in their kinase domains, have been implicated in various cancers.

CDKs are partly regulated by their subcellular localization, which defines substrate phosphorylation and the resulting specific function. CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 have well-defined functions in the cell cycle, such as the regulation of the early G1 phase by CDK4 or CDK6, the G1/S phase transition by CDK2, or the entry of mitosis by CDK1.

In addition, LRRKs contain a catalytic kinase domain and protein-protein interaction motifs including a WD40 domain, LRRs and ankyrin (ANK) repeats. LRRKs possess both GTPase and kinase activities, with the ROC domain acting as a molecular switch for the kinase domain, cycling between a GTP-bound state which drives kinase activity and a GDP-bound state which decreases the activity.

It plays a critical role in T-cell maturation, activation, and T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Lck phosphorylates ITAM (immunoreceptor tyr activation motif) sequences on several subunits of TCRs, leading to the activation of different second messenger cascades.

In addition, Lck regulates drug-induced apoptosis by interfering with the mitochondrial death pathway. The apototic role of Lck is independent of its primary function in T-cell signaling. Blk is expressed specifically in B-cells. It is involved in pre-BCR (B-cell receptor) signaling. Src kinases contain an N-terminal SH4 domain with a myristoylation site, followed by SH3 and SH2 domains, a tyr kinase domain, and a regulatory C-terminal region containing a conserved tyr.

HER2 (ErbB2, HER2/neu) is a member of the EGFR (HER, ErbB) subfamily of proteins, which are receptor PTKs (RTKs) containing an extracellular EGF-related ligand-binding region, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic region with a tyr kinase domain and a regulatory C-terminal tail. Unlike other PTKs, phosphorylation of the activation loop of EGFR proteins is not critical to their activation. Instead, they are activated by ligand-induced dimerization, leading to the phosphorylation of tyr residues in the C-terminal tail, which serve as binding sites for downstream signaling molecules. HER2 does not bind to any known EGFR subfamily ligands, but contributes to the kinase activity of all possible heterodimers. It acts as the preferred partner of other ligand-bound EGFR proteins and functions as a signal amplifier, with the HER2-HER3 heterodimer being the most potent pair in mitogenic signaling. HER2 plays an important role in cell development, proliferation, survival and motility. Overexpression of HER2 results in its activation and downstream signaling, even in the absence of ligand. HER2 overexpression, mainly due to gene amplification, has been shown in a variety of human cancers. Its role in breast cancer is especially well-documented. HER2 is up-regulated in about 25% of breast tumors and is associated with increases in tumor aggressiveness, recurrence and mortality. HER2 is a target for monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors, which are being developed as treatments for cancer. The first humanized antibody approved for clinical use is Trastuzumab (Herceptin), which is being used in combination with other therapies to improve the survival rates of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

The kinase domain of myosin III can phosphorylate several cytoskeletal proteins, conventional myosin regulatory light chains, and can autophosphorylate the C-terminal motor domain. Myosin III may play an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of photoreceptor cell microvilli. It may also function as a cargo carrier during light-dependent translocation, in photoreceptor cells, of proteins such as transducin and arrestin. The Drosophila class III myosin, called NinaC (Neither inactivation nor afterpotential protein C), is critical in normal adaptation and termination of photoresponse.  Vertebrates contain two isoforms of class III myosin, IIIA and IIIB. This subfamily also includes mammalian NIK-like embryo-specific kinase (NESK), Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase kinase 4/6. MAP4Ks are involved in some MAPK signaling pathways by activating a MAPK kinase kinase. MAPK signaling cascades are important in mediating cellular responses to extracellular signals. The class III myosin-like subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

These proteins contain a catalytic kinase domain followed by a C-terminal autoinhibitory region that contains nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export (NES) signals with a p38 MAPK docking motif that overlaps the NLS. In addition, MK2 and MK3 contain an N-terminal proline-rich region that can bind to SH3 domains. MK2 and MK3 are bonafide substrates for the MAPK p38, while MK5 plays a functional role in the p38 MAPK pathway although their direct interaction has been difficult to detect. MK2 and MK3 are closely related and show, thus far, indistinguishable substrate specificity, while MK5 shows a distinct spectrum of substrates. MK2 and MK3 are mainly involved in the regulation of gene expression and they participate in diverse cellular processes such as endocytosis, cytokine production, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, cell cycle control and chromatin remodeling. They are implicated in inflammation and cance and their substrates include mRNA-AU-rich-element (ARE)-binding proteins (TTP and hnRNP A0), Hsp proteins (Hsp27 and Hsp25) and RSK, among others. MK2/3 are both expressed ubiquitously but MK2 is expressed at significantly higher levels.

EIF2AKs phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eIF-2, resulting in the overall downregulation of protein synthesis. eIF-2 phosphorylation is induced in response to cellular stresses including virus infection, heat shock, nutrient deficiency, and the accummulation of unfolded proteins, among others. There are four distinct kinases that phosphorylate eIF-2 and control protein synthesis under different stress conditions: GCN2, protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR), heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI), and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). GCN2 is activated by amino acid or serum starvation and UV irradiation. It induces GCN4, a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes, leading to increased production of amino acids under amino acid-deficient conditions. In serum-starved cells, GCN2 activation induces translation of the stress-responsive transcription factor ATF4, while under UV stress, GCN2 triggers transcriptional rescue via NF-kappaB signaling. GCN2 contains an N-terminal RWD, a degenerate kinase-like (repeat 1), the catalytic kinase (repeat 2), a histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS)-like, and a C-terminal ribosome-binding and dimerization (RB/DD) domains.

This family is composed of the atypical yeast protein kinase Abc1p, its human homolog ADCK3 (also called CABC1), and similar proteins. Abc1p (also called Coq8p) is required for the biosynthesis of Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q), which is an essential lipid component in respiratory electron and proton transport. It is necessary for the formation of a multi-subunit Q-biosynthetic complex and may also function in the regulation of Q synthesis. Human ADCK3 is able to rescue defects in Q synthesis and the phosphorylation state of Coq proteins in yeast Abc1 (or Coq8) mutants. Mutations in ADCK3 cause progressive cerebellar ataxia and atrophy due to Q10 deficiency. Eukaryotes contain at least two more ABC1/ADCK3-like proteins: in humans, these are the putative atypical protein kinases named ADCK1 and ADCK2. In algae and higher plants, ABC1 kinases have proliferated to more than 15 subfamilies, most of which are located in plastids or mitochondria. Eight of these plant ABC1 kinase subfamilies (ABC1K1-8) are specific for photosynthetic organisms. ABC1 kinases are not related to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter family.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine Kinase, novel (nua) kinase family NUAK. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. NUAK proteins are classified as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related kinases, which like AMPK are activated by the major tumor suppressor LKB1. Vertebrates contain two NUAK proteins, called NUAK1 and NUAK2. NUAK1, also called ARK5 (AMPK-related protein kinase 5), regulates cell proliferation and displays tumor suppression through direct interaction and phosphorylation of p53. It is also involved in cell senescence and motility. High NUAK1 expression is associated with invasiveness of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer cells. NUAK2, also called SNARK (Sucrose, non-fermenting 1/AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinase), is involved in energy metabolism. It is activated by hyperosmotic stress, DNA damage, and nutrients such as glucose and glutamine. NUAK2-knockout mice develop obesity, altered serum lipid profiles, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. The NUAK subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of Phototropin-like Serine/Threonine Kinases. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Phototropins are blue-light receptors that control responses such as phototropism, stromatal opening, and chloroplast movement in order to optimize the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. They are light-activated STKs that contain an N-terminal photosensory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain contains two LOV (Light, Oxygen or Voltage) domains that binds FMN. Photoexcitation of the LOV domains results in autophosphorylation at multiple sites and activation of the catalytic domain. In addition to plant phototropins, included in this subfamily are predominantly uncharacterized fungal STKs whose catalytic domains resemble the phototropin kinase domain. One protein from Neurospora crassa is called nrc-2, which plays a role in growth and development by controlling entry into the conidiation program. The phototropin-like subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic Domain of the Protein Tyrosine Kinases, Receptor tyrosine kinase-like Orphan Receptors. PTKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to tyrosine (tyr) residues in protein substrates. The Ror subfamily consists of Ror1, Ror2, and similar proteins. Ror proteins are orphan receptor PTKs (RTKs) containing an extracellular region with immunoglobulin-like, cysteine-rich, and kringle domains, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular catalytic domain. Ror RTKs are unrelated to the nuclear receptor subfamily called retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs). RTKs are usually activated through ligand binding, which causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyr kinase catalytic domain. Ror kinases are expressed in many tissues during development. They play important roles in bone and heart formation. Mutations in human Ror2 result in two different bone development genetic disorders, recessive Robinow syndrome and brachydactyly type B. Drosophila Ror is expressed only in the developing nervous system during neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation, suggesting a role for Drosophila Ror in neural development. More recently, mouse Ror1 and Ror2 have also been found to play an important role in regulating neurite growth in central neurons. Ror1 and Ror2 are believed to have some overlapping and redundant functions. The Ror subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other kinases such as protein serine/threonine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of the Protein Tyrosine Kinases, Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristylation sites (Srm) and Breast tumor kinase (Brk). PTKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to tyrosine (tyr) residues in protein substrates. Srm and Brk (also called protein tyrosine kinase 6) are members of the Src subfamily of proteins, which are cytoplasmic (or non-receptor) PTKs. Brk has been found to be overexpressed in a majority of breast tumors. Src kinases in general contain an N-terminal SH4 domain with a myristoylation site, followed by SH3 and SH2 domains, a tyr kinase domain, and a regulatory C-terminal region containing a conserved tyr; they are activated by autophosphorylation at the tyr kinase domain, but are negatively regulated by phosphorylation at the C-terminal tyr by Csk (C-terminal Src Kinase). Srm and Brk however, lack the N-terminal myristylation sites. Src proteins are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cytokine and growth factor responses, cytoskeleton dynamics, cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.  The Srm/Brk subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other kinases such as serine/threonine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

It is enriched in the centrosome and is critical for microtubule nucleation. Nek7 is activated by Nek9 during mitosis, and may regulate the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase. It is one in a family of 11 different Neks (Nek1-11) that are involved in cell cycle control.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. The nematode Unc-89 gene, through alternative promoter use and splicing, encodes at least six major isoforms (Unc-89A to Unc-89F) of giant muscle proteins that are homologs for the vetebrate obscurin. In flies, five isoforms of Unc-89 have been detected: four in the muscles of adult flies (two in the indirect flight muscle and two in other muscles) and another isoform in the larva. Unc-89 in nematodes is required for normal muscle cell architecture. In flies, it is necessary for the development of a symmetrical sarcomere in the flight muscles. Unc-89 proteins contain several adhesion and signaling domains including multiple copies of the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, as well as fibronectin type III (FN3), SH3, RhoGEF, and PH domains. The nematode Unc-89 isoforms D, C, D, and F contain two kinase domain with B and F having two complete kinase domains while the first repeat of C and D are partial domains. Homology modeling suggests that the first kinase repeat of Unc-89 may be catalytically inactive, a pseudokinase, while the second kinase repeat may be active. The Unc-89 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

PTKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to tyrosine (tyr) residues in protein substrates. Tyk2 is widely expressed in many tissues. It is involved in signaling via the cytokine receptors IFN-alphabeta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-23. It mediates cell surface urokinase receptor (uPAR) signaling and plays a role in modulating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) functional behavior in response to injury. Tyk2 is also important in dendritic cell function and T helper (Th)1 cell differentiation. A homozygous mutation of Tyk2 was found in a patient with hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), a primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent skin abscesses, pneumonia, and elevated serum IgE. This suggests that Tyk2 may play important roles in multiple cytokine signaling involved in innate and adaptive immunity. Tyk2 is a member of the Janus kinase (Jak) subfamily of proteins, which are cytoplasmic (or nonreceptor) PTKs containing an N-terminal FERM domain, followed by a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, a pseudokinase domain, and a C-terminal tyr kinase catalytic domain. Jaks are crucial for cytokine receptor signaling. They are activated by autophosphorylation upon cytokine-induced receptor aggregation, and subsequently trigger downstream signaling events such as the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The Tyk2 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other kinases such as protein serine/threonine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily is composed of Bub1 (Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1), BubR1, and similar proteins. They contain an N-terminal Bub1/Mad3 homology domain essential for Cdc20 binding and a C-terminal kinase domain. Bub1 and BubR1 are involved in SAC, a surveillance system that delays metaphase to anaphase transition by blocking the activity of APC/C (the anaphase promoting complex) until all chromosomes achieve proper attachments to the mitotic spindle, to avoid chromosome missegregation. Impaired SAC leads to genomic instabilities and tumor development. Bub1 and BubR1 facilitate the localization of SAC proteins to kinetochores and regulate kinetochore-microtubule (K-MT) attachments. Repression studies of Bub1 and BubR1 show that they exert an additive effect in misalignment phenotypes and may function cooperatively or in parallel pathways in regulating K-MT attachments. The Bub1/BubR1 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. DAPKs mediate cell death and act as tumor suppressors. They are necessary to induce cell death and their overexpression leads to death-associated changes including membrane blebbing, cell rounding, and formation of autophagic vesicles. Vertebrates contain three subfamily members with different domain architecture, localization, and function. DAPK1 is the prototypical member of the subfamily and is also simply referred to as DAPK. DAPK2 is also called DAPK-related protein 1 (DRP-1), while DAPK3 has also been named DAP-like kinase (DLK) and zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPk). These proteins are ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues, are capable of cross talk with each other, and may act synergistically in regulating cell death. The DAPK subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

MST1/2 and Hippo are involved in a conserved pathway that governs cell contact inhibition, organ size control, and tumor development. MST1 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) through MKK7 and MEKK1 by acting as a MAPK kinase kinase kinase. Activation of JNK by MST1 leads to caspase activation and apoptosis. MST1 has also been implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation. Krs1 may regulate cell growth arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular stress.

It associates with Trap (Tudor repeat associator with PCTAIRE-2) and could play a role in regulating mitochondrial function in neurons. PCTAIRE-2 shares sequence similarity with Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs), which belong to a large family of STKs that are regulated by their cognate cyclins.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. WNKs comprise a subfamily of STKs with an unusual placement of a catalytic lysine relative to all other protein kinases. They are critical in regulating ion balance and are thus, important components in the control of blood pressure. They are also involved in cell signaling, survival, proliferation, and organ development. WNKs are activated by hyperosmotic or low-chloride hypotonic stress and they function upstream of SPAK and OSR1 kinases, which regulate the activity of cation-chloride cotransporters through direct interaction and phosphorylation. There are four vertebrate WNKs which show varying expression patterns. WNK1 and WNK2 are widely expressed while WNK3 and WNK4 show a more restricted expression pattern. Because mutations in human WNK1 and WNK4 cause PseudoHypoAldosteronism type II (PHAII), characterized by hypertension (due to increased sodium reabsorption) and hyperkalemia (due to impaired renal potassium secretion), there are more studies conducted on these two proteins, compared to WNK2 and WNK3.
