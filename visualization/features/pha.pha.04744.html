Diguanylate-cyclase (DGC) or GGDEF domain: Originally named after a conserved residue pattern, and initially described as a domain of unknown function 1 (DUF1). This domain is widely present in bacteria, linked to a wide range of non-homologous domains in a variety of cell signaling proteins. The domain shows homology to the adenylyl cyclase catalytic domain. This correlates with the functional information available on two GGDEF-containing proteins, namely diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase A of Acetobacter xylinum, both of which regulate the turnover of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate. Together with the EAL domain, GGDEF might be involved in regulating cell surface adhesion in bacteria.</td>

            <td id=al>pfam00990 Diguanylate cyclase, GGDEF domain. This domain is found linked to a wide range of non-homologous domains in a variety of bacteria. It has been shown to be homologous to the adenylyl cyclase catalytic domain and has diguanylate cyclase activity. This observation correlates with the functional information available on two GGDEF-containing proteins, namely diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase A of Acetobacter xylinum, both of which regulate the turnover of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate. In the WspR protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the GGDEF domain acts as a diguanylate cyclase, Structure 3bre, when the whole molecule appears to form a tetramer consisting of two symmetrically-related dimers representing a biological unit. The active site is the GGD/EF motif, buried in the structure, and the cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) bind to the inhibitory-motif RxxD on the surface. The enzyme thus catalyzes the cyclisation of two guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules to one c-di-GMP molecule.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00383 DNA-binding effector domain of two-component system response regulators. Bacteria and some eukaryotes use two-component signal transduction systems to detect and respond to changes in the environment. The systems consists of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. The former autophosphorylates a histidine residue on detecting an external stimulus. The phosphate is then transferred to an invariant aspartate residue in a highly conserved receiver domain of the response regulator. Phosphorylation activates a variable effector domain of the response regulator, which triggers the cellular response. This C-terminal effector domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcriptional regulators and contains DNA and RNA polymerase binding sites. Several dimers or monomers bind head to tail to small tandem repeats upstream of the genes. The RNA polymerase binding sites interact with the alpha or sigma subunit of RNA polymerase.</td>

Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains.

The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants.

            <td id=al>cd17546 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CKI1 and Escherichia coli RcsC. This family is composed of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators that are sensor histidine kinases (HKs) fused with a REC domain, similar to the sensor histidine kinase CKI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) signaling that mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. MSP involves a signal being transferred from HKs via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. The CKI1 REC domain specifically interacts with the downstream signaling protein AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. The plant MSP system has evolved from the prokaryotic two-component system (TCS), which allows organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. This family also includes bacterial hybrid sensor HKs such as Escherichia coli RcsC, which is a component of the Rcs signalling pathway that controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division, and motility. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

PleD contains a REC domain (D1) with the phosphorylatable aspartate, a pseudo receiver (psREC)-like adaptor domain (D2), and the enzymatic diguanylate cyclase (DGC) domain, also called the GGDEF domain according to a conserved sequence motif, as its output domain. The GGDEF-containing PleD response regulators are global regulators of cell metabolism in some important human pathogens. This model describes the REC-like adaptor domain D2 of PleD, which is an inactive domain.</td>

Ycf29 is a probable response regulator of a two-component system (TCS), typically consisting a sensor and a response regulator, that functions in adaptation to changing environments. Processes regulated by TCSs in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport.

They directly regulate the expression of type-A ARR genes and other downstream target genes. Cytokinin is a plant hormone implicated in many growth and development processes including shoot organogenesis, leaf senescence, sink/source relationships, vascular development, lateral bud release, and photomorphogenic development. Cytokinin signaling involves a phosphorelay cascade by histidine kinase receptors (AHKs), histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) and downstream ARRs. ARRs are divided into two groups, type-A and -B, according to their sequence and domain structure. Type-B ARRs contain a receiver (REC) domain and a large C-terminal extension that has characteristics of an effector or output domain, with a Myb-like DNA binding domain referred to as the GARP domain. The GARP domain is a motif specific to plant transcription factors.

Class III nucleotidyl cyclases are the largest, most diverse group of nucleotidyl cyclases (NC's) containing prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. They can be divided into two major groups; the mononucleotidyl cyclases (MNC's) and the diguanylate cyclases (DGC's).  The MNC's, which include the adenylate cyclases (AC's) and the guanylate cyclases (GC's), have a conserved cyclase homology domain (CHD), while the DGC's have a conserved GGDEF domain, named after a conserved motif within this subgroup. Their products, cyclic guanylyl and adenylyl nucleotides, are second messengers that play important roles in eukaryotic signal transduction and prokaryotic sensory pathways.</td>

The coordinated sequential expression of PRR9 (APRR9), PRR7 (APRR7), PRR5 (APRR5), PRR3 (APRR3), and PRR1 (APRR1) results in circadian waves that may be at the basis of the endogenous circadian clock.
