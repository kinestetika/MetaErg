            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in sucrose phosphorylase-like proteins (also called sucrose glucosyltransferase, disaccharide glucosyltransferase, and sucrose-phosphate alpha-D glucosyltransferase). Sucrose phosphorylase is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorolysis of sucrose to yield glucose-1-phosphate and fructose. These enzymes do not have the conserved calcium ion present in other alpha amylase family enzymes. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.</td>

            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in Amylosucrase. Amylosucrase is a glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a D-glucopyranosyl moiety from sucrose onto an acceptor molecule. When the acceptor is another saccharide, only alpha-1,4 linkages are produced. Unlike most amylopolysaccharide synthases, it does not require any alpha-D-glucosyl nucleoside diphosphate substrate. In the presence of glycogen it catalyzes the transfer of a D-glucose moiety onto a glycogen branch, but in its absence, it hydrolyzes sucrose and synthesizes polymers, smaller maltosaccharides, and sucrose isoforms.

            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in Trehalose synthetase. Trehalose synthetase (TreS) catalyzes the reversible interconversion of trehalose and maltose. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction in both directions, but the preferred substrate is maltose. Glucose is formed as a by-product of this reaction. It is believed that the catalytic mechanism may involve the cutting of the incoming disaccharide and transfer of a glucose to an enzyme-bound glucose. This enzyme also catalyzes production of a glucosamine disaccharide from maltose and glucosamine. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides.

            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in bacterial Alpha-amylases (also called 1,4-alpha-D-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase). AmyA (EC 3.2.1.1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of alpha-(1,4) glycosidic linkages of glycogen, starch, related polysaccharides, and some oligosaccharides. This group includes Chloroflexi, Dictyoglomi, and Fusobacteria.

            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in maltase (also known as alpha glucosidase) and related proteins. Maltase (EC 3.2.1.20) hydrolyzes the terminal, non-reducing (1->4)-linked alpha-D-glucose residues in maltose, releasing alpha-D-glucose. In most cases, maltase is equivalent to alpha-glucosidase, but the term "maltase" emphasizes the disaccharide nature of the substrate from which glucose is cleaved, and the term "alpha-glucosidase" emphasizes the bond, whether the substrate is a disaccharide or polysaccharide. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C.

            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in Sucrose isomerases, oligo-1,6-glucosidase (also called isomaltase; sucrase-isomaltase; alpha-limit dextrinase), dextran glucosidase (also called glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase), and related proteins. The sucrose isomerases (SIs) Isomaltulose synthase (EC 5.4.99.11) and Trehalose synthase (EC 5.4.99.16) catalyze the isomerization of sucrose and maltose to produce isomaltulose and trehalulose, respectively. Oligo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.10) hydrolyzes the alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkage of isomaltooligosaccharides, pannose, and dextran. Unlike alpha-1,4-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.20), it fails to hydrolyze the alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds of maltosaccharides. Dextran glucosidase (DGase, EC 3.2.1.70) hydrolyzes alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages at the non-reducing end of panose, isomaltooligosaccharides and dextran to produce alpha-glucose.The common reaction chemistry of the alpha-amylase family enzymes is based on a two-step acid catalytic mechanism that requires two critical carboxylates: one acting as a general acid/base (Glu) and the other as a nucleophile (Asp). Both hydrolysis and transglycosylation proceed via the nucleophilic substitution reaction between the anomeric carbon, C1 and a nucleophile. Both enzymes contain the three catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) common to the alpha-amylase family as well as two histidine residues which are predicted to be critical to binding the glucose residue adjacent to the scissile bond in the substrates. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C.

The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.</td>

Oligo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.10) hydrolyzes the alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkage of isomaltooligosaccharides, pannose, and dextran. Unlike alpha-1,4-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.20), it fails to hydrolyze the alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds of maltosaccharides. Trehalose synthase (EC 5.4.99.16) catalyzes the isomerization of maltose to produce trehalulose. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key.
