            <td id=al>cd00950 Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS). Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) is a key enzyme in lysine biosynthesis. It catalyzes the aldol condensation of L-aspartate-beta- semialdehyde and pyruvate to dihydropicolinic acid via a Schiff base formation between pyruvate and a lysine residue. The functional enzyme is a homotetramer consisting of a dimer of dimers. DHDPS is member of dihydrodipicolinate synthase family that comprises several pyruvate-dependent class I aldolases that use the same catalytic step to catalyze different reactions in different pathways.</td>

Members of this family are 4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate synthase, previously (incorrectly) called dihydrodipicolinate synthase. It is a homotetrameric enzyme of lysine biosynthesis. E. coli has several paralogs closely related to dihydrodipicoline synthase (DapA), as well as the more distant N-acetylneuraminate lyase. In Pyrococcus horikoshii, the bidirectional best hit with E. coli is to an uncharacterized paralog of DapA, not DapA itself, and it is omitted from the seed. The putative members from the Chlamydias (pathogens with a parasitic metabolism) are easily the most divergent members of the multiple alignment. [Amino acid biosynthesis, Aspartate family]</td>

The dihydrodipicolinate synthase family comprises several pyruvate-dependent class I aldolases that use the same catalytic step to catalyze different reactions in different pathways and includes such proteins as N-acetylneuraminate lyase, MosA protein, 5-keto-4-deoxy-glucarate dehydratase, trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase, trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase, and 2-keto-3-deoxy- gluconate aldolase.

            <td id=al>TIGR02313 2,4-dihydroxyhept-2-ene-1,7-dioic acid aldolase. This model represents a subset of the DapA (dihydrodipicolinate synthase) family which has apparently evolved a separate function. The product of DapA, dihydrodipicolinate, results from the non-enzymatic cyclization and dehydration of 6-amino-2,4-dihydroxyhept-2-ene-1,7-dioic acid, which is different from the substrate of this reaction only in the presence of the amino group. In the absence of this amino group, and running the reaction in the opposite direction, the reaction corresponds to the HpaI aldolase component of the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid catabolism pathway (see TIGR02311). At present, this variant of DapA is found only in Oceanobacillus iheyensis HTE831 and Thermus thermophilus HB27. In both of these cases, one or more other DapA genes can be found and the one identified by this model is part of an operon for 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid catabolism.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00954 N-Acetylneuraminic acid aldolase, also called N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NAL). N-Acetylneuraminic acid aldolase, also called N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NAL), which catalyses the reversible aldol reaction of N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and pyruvate to give N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid (D-sialic acid). It has a widespread application as biocatalyst for the synthesis of sialic acid and its derivatives. This enzyme has been shown to be quite specific for pyruvate as the donor, but flexible to a variety of D- and, to some extent, L-hexoses and pentoses as acceptor substrates. NAL is member of dihydrodipicolinate synthase family that comprises several pyruvate-dependent class I aldolases.</td>

The enzyme is involved in glucarate metabolism, and its mechanism presumbly involves a Schiff-base intermediate similar to members of DHDPS family. While in the case of Pseudomonas sp. 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate is degraded by KDGDH to 2,5-dioxopentanoate, in certain species of Enterobacteriaceae it is degraded instead to pyruvate and glycerate.</td>

Trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase (HBPHA) and trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase (CBPHA). HBPHA catalyzes HBP to salicyaldehyde and pyruvate. This reaction is part of the degradative pathways for naphthalene and naphthalenesulfonates by bacteria. CBPHA is homologous to HBPHA and catalyzes the cleavage of CBP to 2-carboxylbenzaldehyde and pyruvate during the degradation of phenanthrene. They are member of the DHDPS family of Schiff-base-dependent class I aldolases.</td>

This subfamily of enzymes is adapted for high thermostability and shows specificity for non-phosphorylated substrates. The enzyme catalyses the reversible aldol cleavage of 2-keto-3-dexoygluconate to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde, the third step of a modified non-phosphorylated Entner-Doudoroff pathway of glucose oxidation. KDG aldolase shows no significant sequence similarity to microbial 2-keto-3-deoxyphosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolases, and the enzyme shows no activity with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrate. The enzyme is a tetramer and a member of the DHDPS family of Schiff-base-dependent class I aldolases.</td>
