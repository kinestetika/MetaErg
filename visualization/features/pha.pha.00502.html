The leucyl-tRNA synthetases belong to two families so broadly different that they are represented by separate models. This model includes both eubacterial and mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetases. It generates higher scores for some valyl-tRNA synthetases than for any archaeal or eukaryotic cytosolic leucyl-tRNA synthetase. Note that the enzyme from Aquifex aeolicus is split into alpha and beta chains; neither chain is long enough to score above the trusted cutoff, but the alpha chain scores well above the noise cutoff. The beta chain must be found by a model and search designed for partial length matches. [Protein synthesis, tRNA aminoacylation]</td>

This class I enzyme is a monomer which aminoacylates the 2'-OH of the nucleotide at the 3' of the appropriate tRNA. The core domain is based on the Rossman fold and is responsible for the ATP-dependent formation of the enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate. It contains the characteristic class I HIGH and KMSKS motifs, which are involved in ATP binding. In Aquifex aeolicus, the gene encoding LeuRS is split in two, just before the KMSKS motif. Consequently, LeuRS is a heterodimer, which likely superimposes with the LeuRS monomer found in most other organisms. LeuRS has an insertion in the core domain, which is subject to both deletions and rearrangements and thus differs between prokaryotic LeuRS and archaeal/eukaryotic LeuRS. This editing region hydrolyzes mischarged cognate tRNAs and thus prevents the incorporation of chemically similar amino acids.</td>

This domain is found in leucyl tRNA synthetases (LeuRS), which belong to the class Ia aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. It lies C-terminal to the catalytic core domain. In contrast to other class Ia enzymes, the anticodon is not used as an identity element in LeuRS (with exceptions such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and some other eukaryotes). No anticodon-binding site can be defined for this family, which includes bacterial and eukaryotic mitochondrial members, as well as LeuRS from the archaeal Halobacteria. LeuRS catalyzes the transfer of leucine to the 3'-end of its tRNA.</td>

The core domain is based on the Rossman fold and is responsible for the ATP-dependent formation of the enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate. It contains the characteristic class I HIGH and KMSKS motifs, which are involved in ATP binding.  As a result of a deletion event, MetRS has a significantly shorter core domain insertion than IleRS, ValRS, and LeuR.  Consequently, the MetRS insertion lacks the editing function.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00818 catalytic core domain of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases. Isoleucine amino-acyl tRNA synthetases (IleRS) catalytic core domain . This class I enzyme is a monomer which aminoacylates the 2'-OH of the nucleotide at the 3' of the appropriate tRNA. The core domain is based on the Rossman fold and is responsible for the ATP-dependent formation of the enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate. It contains the characteristic class I HIGH and KMSKS motifs, which are involved in ATP binding.  IleRS has an insertion in the core domain, which is subject to both deletions and rearrangements. This editing region hydrolyzes mischarged cognate tRNAs and thus prevents the incorporation of chemically similar amino acids.</td>

This domain is found in leucyl tRNA synthetases (LeuRS), which belong to the class Ia aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. It lies C-terminal to the catalytic core domain. In contrast to other class Ia enzymes, the anticodon is not used as an identity element in LeuRS (with exceptions such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and some other eukaryotes). No anticodon-binding site can be defined for this family, which includes archaeal and eukaryotic cytoplasmic members. LeuRS catalyzes the transfer of leucine to the 3'-end of its tRNA.</td>

This domain is found in a variety of class Ia aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, C-terminal to the catalytic core domain. It recognizes and specifically binds to the anticodon of the tRNA. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases catalyze the transfer of cognate amino acids to the 3'-end of their tRNAs by specifically recognizing cognate from non-cognate amino acids. Members include valyl-, leucyl-, isoleucyl-, cysteinyl-, arginyl-, and methionyl-tRNA synthethases. This superfamily also includes a domain from MshC, an enzyme in the mycothiol biosynthetic pathway.</td>
