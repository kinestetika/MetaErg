            <td id=al>Uracil DNA glycosylase family 4, includes Thermotoga maritima TTUDGA, Bacillus phage SPO1 DNA polymerase, and similar proteins. Uracil DNA glycosylase family 4 includes Thermotoga maritima TTUDGA, a robust uracil DNA glycosylase that shares narrow substrate specificity and high catalytic efficiency with family 1, acting on double-stranded and single-stranded uracil-containing DNA. Members of this family possess four conserved cysteine residues required to coordinate the [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster. This family also includes the N-terminal domain of Bacillus phage SPO1 DNA polymerase. Bacteriophage SPO1 is one of a group of large, lytic, tailed bacteriophages of Bacillus subtilis, and contains hydroxymethyluracil (hmUra) in place of thymine in their DNA. It has been speculated that this UDG domain may help discriminate between hmUra containing SPO1 DNA and thymine-containing host DNA. Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) initiate repair of uracils in DNA. Uracil in DNA can arise as a result of mis-incorporation of dUMP residues by DNA polymerase or via deamination of cytosine. Uracil in DNA mispaired with guanine is one of the major pro-mutagenic events, causing G:C->A:T mutations. Thus, UDG is an essential enzyme for maintaining the integrity of genetic information. UDGs have been classified into various families on the basis of their substrate specificity, conserved motifs, and structural similarities. Although these families demonstrate different substrate specificities, often the function of one enzyme can be complemented by the other.</td>

            <td id=al>uracil-DNA glycosylase, family 4. This well-conserved family of proteins is about 200 residues in length and homologous to the N-terminus of the DNA polymerase of phage SPO1 of Bacillus subtilis. The member from Thermus thermophilus HB8 is known to act as uracil-DNA glycosylase, an enzyme of DNA base excision repair. Its appearance as a domain of phage DNA polymerases could be consistent with uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. [DNA metabolism, DNA replication, recombination, and repair]</td>

            <td id=al>uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDG) and related enzymes. Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) initiate repair of uracils in DNA. Uracil may arise from misincorporation of dUMP residues by DNA polymerase or via deamination of cytosine. Uracil in DNA mispaired with guanine is one of the major pro-mutagenic events, causing G:C->A:T mutations; thus, UDG is an essential enzyme for maintaining the integrity of genetic information. UDGs have been classified into various families on the basis of their substrate specificity, conserved motifs, and structural similarities. Although these families demonstrate different substrate specificities, often the function of one enzyme can be complemented by the other. UDG family 1 is the most efficient uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG, also known as UNG) and shows a specificity for uracil in DNA. UDG family 2 includes thymine DNA glycosylase which removes uracil and thymine from G:U and G:T mismatches, and mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) which in Escherichia coli is highly specific to G:U mismatches, but also repairs G:T mismatches at high enzyme concentration. UDG family 3 includes Human SMUG1 which can remove uracil and its oxidized pyrimidine derivatives from, single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA with a preference for single-stranded DNA. Pedobacter heparinus SMUG2, which is UDG family 3 SMUG1-like, displays catalytic activities towards DNA containing uracil or hypoxanthine/xanthine. UDG family 4 includes Thermotoga maritima TTUDGA, a robust UDG which like family 1, acts on double-stranded and single-stranded uracil-containing DNA. UDG family 5 (UDGb) includes Thermus thermophilus HB8 TTUDGB which acts on double-stranded uracil-containing DNA; it is a hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase acting on double-stranded hypoxanthine-containing DNA except for the C/I base pair, as well as a xanthine DNA glycosylase which acts on both double-stranded and single-stranded xanthine-containing DNA. UDG family 6 hypoxanthine-DNA glycosylase lacks any detectable UDG activity; it excises hypoxanthine. Other UDG families include one represented by Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens Blr0248 which prefers single-stranded DNA and removes uracil, 5-hydroxymethyl-uracil or xanthine from it.</td>

            <td id=al>Uracil DNA glycosylase family 5, includes Thermotoga maritima TTUDGB and similar proteins. Uracil DNA glycosylase family 5 includes Thermus thermophilus HB8 TTUDGB (also called UDGb) which is not only a UDG acting on double-stranded uracil-containing DNA, but also a hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase acting on double-stranded hypoxanthine-containing DNA (except for the C/I base pair), as well as a xanthine DNA glycosylase acting on both, double-stranded and single-stranded xanthine-containing DNA.  TTUDGB also excises thymine from G:T mismatched DNA, and removes analogs of uracil from DNA, including 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) and 5-fluorouracil (fU). This subfamily also contains Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens family 5 homolog Blr5068 (UdgB) which has been found to efficiently excise uracil from ssDNA and dsDNA. Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) initiate repair of uracils in DNA. Similar to family 4 UDGs, members of this family possess four conserved cysteine residues required to coordinate the [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster. Uracil in DNA can arise as a result of mis-incorporation of dUMP residues by DNA polymerase or via deamination of cytosine.
