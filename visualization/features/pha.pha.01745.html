            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in cyclomaltodextrinases and related proteins. Cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase; EC3.2.1.54), neopullulanase (NPase; EC 3.2.1.135), and maltogenic amylase (MA; EC 3.2.1.133) catalyze the hydrolysis of alpha-(1,4) glycosidic linkages on a number of substrates including cyclomaltodextrins (CDs), pullulan, and starch. These enzymes hydrolyze CDs and starch to maltose and pullulan to panose by cleavage of alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds whereas alpha-amylases essentially lack activity on CDs and pullulan. They also catalyze transglycosylation of oligosaccharides to the C3-, C4- or C6-hydroxyl groups of various acceptor sugar molecules. Since these proteins are nearly indistinguishable from each other, they are referred to as cyclomaltodextrinases (CMDs). The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.</td>

In the case of CGTases, an additional cyclization reaction is catalyzed yielding mixtures of cyclic oligosaccharides which are referred to as alpha-, beta-, or gamma-cyclodextrins (CDs), consisting of six, seven, or eight glucose residues, respectively. CGTases are characterized depending on the major product of the cyclization reaction. Besides having similar catalytic site residues, amylases and CGTases contain carbohydrate binding domains that are distant from the active site and are implicated in attaching the enzyme to raw starch granules and in guiding the amylose chain into the active site. The maltogenic alpha-amylase from Bacillus is a five-domain structure, unlike most alpha-amylases, but similar to that of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase. In addition to the A, B, and C domains, they have a domain D and a starch-binding domain E. Maltogenic amylase is an endo-acting amylase that has activity on cyclodextrins, terminally modified linear maltodextrins, and amylose. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.</td>

Dextran glucosidase (DGase, EC 3.2.1.70) hydrolyzes alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages at the non-reducing end of panose, isomaltooligosaccharides and dextran to produce alpha-glucose.The common reaction chemistry of the alpha-amylase family enzymes is based on a two-step acid catalytic mechanism that requires two critical carboxylates: one acting as a general acid/base (Glu) and the other as a nucleophile (Asp). Both hydrolysis and transglycosylation proceed via the nucleophilic substitution reaction between the anomeric carbon, C1 and a nucleophile. Both enzymes contain the three catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) common to the alpha-amylase family as well as two histidine residues which are predicted to be critical to binding the glucose residue adjacent to the scissile bond in the substrates.

            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in Glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (also called Maltooligosyl trehalose Trehalohydrolase). Glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (GTHase) was discovered as part of a coupled system for the production of trehalose from soluble starch. In the first half of the reaction, glycosyltrehalose synthase (GTSase), an intramolecular glycosyl transferase, converts the glycosidic bond between the last two glucose residues of amylose from an alpha-1,4 bond to an alpha-1,1 bond, making a non-reducing glycosyl trehaloside. In the second half of the reaction, GTHase cleaves the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond adjacent to the trehalose moiety to release trehalose and malto-oligosaccharide. Like isoamylase and other glycosidases that recognize branched oligosaccharides, GTHase contains an N-terminal extension and does not have the conserved calcium ion present in other alpha amylase family enzymes. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31).

MTSase is responsible for converting the alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage to an alpha,alpha-1,1-glucosidic linkage at the reducing end of the maltooligosaccharide through an intramolecular transglucosylation reaction, while MTHase hydrolyzes the penultimate alpha-1,4 linkage of the reducing end, resulting in the release of trehalose.

Amylosucrase is a glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a D-glucopyranosyl moiety from sucrose onto an acceptor molecule. When the acceptor is another saccharide, only alpha-1,4 linkages are produced. Unlike most amylopolysaccharide synthases, it does not require any alpha-D-glucosyl nucleoside diphosphate substrate.

            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in glycogen debranching enzymes. Debranching enzymes facilitate the breakdown of glycogen through glucosyltransferase and glucosidase activity. These activities are performed by a single enzyme in mammals, yeast, and some bacteria, but by two distinct enzymes in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Debranching enzymes perform two activities: 4-alpha-D-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) and amylo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.33). 4-alpha-D-glucanotransferase catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,6-alpha-D-glucoside linkages at points of branching in chains of 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues. Amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,6-alpha-D-glucoside linkages at points of branching in chains of 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues. In Escherichia coli, GlgX is the debranching enzyme and malQ is the 4-alpha-glucanotransferase. TreX, an archaeal glycogen-debranching enzyme has dual activities like mammals and yeast, but is structurally similar to GlgX. TreX exists in two oligomeric states, a dimer and tetramer. Isoamylase (EC 3.2.1.68) is one of the starch-debranching enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages specific in alpha-glucans such as amylopectin or glycogen and their beta-limit dextrins.

            <td id=al>Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in maltosyltransferase. Maltosyltransferase (MTase), a maltodextrin glycosyltransferase, acts on starch and maltooligosaccharides. It catalyzes the transfer of maltosyl units from alpha-1,4-linked glucans or maltooligosaccharides to other alpha-1,4-linked glucans, maltooligosaccharides or glucose. MTase is a homodimer. The catalytic core domain has the (beta/alpha) 8 barrel fold with the active-site cleft formed at the C-terminal end of the barrel. Substrate binding experiments have led to the location of two distinct maltose-binding sites: one lies in the active-site cleft and the other is located in a pocket adjacent to the active-site cleft. It is a member of the alpha-amylase family, but unlike typical alpha-amylases, MTase does not require calcium for activity and lacks two histidine residues which are predicted to be critical for binding the glucose residue adjacent to the scissile bond in the substrates. The common reaction chemistry of the alpha-amylase family of enzymes is based on a two-step acid catalytic mechanism that requires two critical carboxylates: one acting as a general acid/base (Glu) and the other as a nucleophile (Asp). Both hydrolysis and transglycosylation proceed via the nucleophilic substitution reaction between the anomeric carbon, C1 and a nucleophile.
