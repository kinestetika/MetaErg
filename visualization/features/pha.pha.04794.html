            <td id=al>leucine-rich repeats. A leucine-rich repeat (LRR) is a structural protein motif of 20-30 amino acids that is unusually rich in the hydrophobic amino acid leucine. The conserved eleven-residue sequence motif (LxxLxLxxN/CxL) within the LRRs corresponds to the beta-strand and adjacent loop regions, whereas the remaining parts of the repeats are variable. LRRs fold together to form a solenoid protein domain, termed leucine-rich repeat domain. Leucine-rich repeats are usually involved in protein-protein interactions.</td>
