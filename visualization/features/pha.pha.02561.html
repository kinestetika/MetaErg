            <td id=al>RNAaseJ, MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase domain. RNase J, also called Ribonuclease J, is a prokaryotic ribonuclease which plays a key part in RNA processing and in RNA degradation. It can act as an endonuclease which is specific for single-stranded regions of RNA irrespective of their sequence or location, and as a processive 5' exonuclease which only acts on substrates having a single phosphate or a hydroxyl at the 5' end. Many bacterial species have only one RNase J, but some, such as Bacillus subtilis, have two. Members of this subgroup belong to the MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase superfamily which is comprised mainly of hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions.</td>

Except for the competence protein these proteins bind two zinc ions per molecule as cofactor.</td>

Classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, however the diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry.</td>

Members of the MBL-fold metallohydrolase superfamily are mainly hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions.

The diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry, for example classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, human persulfide dioxygenase ETHE1 is a mono-iron binding member of the superfamily; Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases incorporates iron, manganese, and zinc in its dinuclear metal binding site, and flavodiiron proteins contains a diiron site.</td>
