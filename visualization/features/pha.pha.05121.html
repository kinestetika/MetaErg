SpoT (EC 3.1.7.2) degrades ppGpp, but may also act as a secondary ppGpp synthetase. The two proteins are strongly similar. In many species, a single homolog to SpoT and RelA appears reponsible for both ppGpp synthesis and ppGpp degradation.

This region is often found in association with HD (pfam01966), a metal-dependent phosphohydrolase, TGS (pfam02824) which is a possible nucleotide-binding region, and the ACT regulatory domain (pfam01842).</td>

            <td id=al>cd05399 Nucleotidyltransferase (NT) domain of RelA- and SpoT-like ppGpp synthetases and hydrolases. This family includes the catalytic domains of Escherichia coli ppGpp synthetase (RelA), ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase (SpoT), and related proteins. RelA synthesizes (p)ppGpp in response to amino-acid starvation and in association with ribosomes. (p)ppGpp triggers the bacterial stringent response. SpoT catalyzes (p)ppGpp synthesis under carbon limitation in a ribosome-independent manner. It also catalyzes (p)ppGpp degradation. Gram-negative bacteria have two enzymes involved in (p)ppGpp metabolism while most Gram-positive organisms have a single Rel-Spo enzyme (Rel), which both synthesizes and degrades (p)ppGpp. The Arabidopsis thaliana Rel-Spo proteins, At-RSH1,-2, and-3 appear to regulate a rapid (p)ppGpp-mediated response to pathogens and other stresses. This catalytic domain is found in association with an N-terminal HD domain and a C-terminal metal dependent phosphohydrolase domain (TGS). Some Rel-Spo proteins also have a C-terminal regulatory ACT domain. This subgroup belongs to the Pol beta-like NT superfamily. In the majority of enzymes in this superfamily, two carboxylates, Dx[D/E], together with a third more distal carboxylate, coordinate two divalent metal cations involved in a two-metal ion mechanism of nucleotide addition.Two of the three catalytic carboxylates are found in Rel-Spo enzymes, with the second carboxylate of the DXD motif missing. Evidence supports a single-cation synthetase mechanism.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01668 TGS (ThrRS, GTPase and SpoT) domain found in the RelA/SpoT homolog (RSH) family. The RelA/SpoT homolog (RSH) family consists of long RSH proteins and short RSH proteins. Long RSH proteins have been characterized as containing an N-terminal region and a C-terminal region. The N-terminal region contains a pseudo-hydrolase (inactive-hydrolase) domain and a (p)ppGpp synthetase domain. The C-terminal region contains a ubiquitin-like TGS (ThrRS, GTPase and SpoT) domain, a conserved cysteine domain (CC), helical and ACT (aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase, TyrA domain) domains connected by a linker region. Short RSH proteins have a truncated C-terminal region without ACT domain. The RSH family includes two classes of enzyme: i) monofunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase I, RelA, and ii) bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase II/hydrolase, SpoT (also called Rel). Both classes are capable of synthesizing (p)ppGpp but only bifunctional enzymes are capable of (p)ppGpp hydrolysis. SpoT is a ribosome-associated protein that is activated during amino acid starvation and thought to mediate the stringent response. The function of the TGS domain of SpoT is in transcription of survival and virulence genes in respond to environmental stress.  RelA is an ATP:GTP(GDP) pyrophosphate transferase that is recruited to stalled ribosomes and activated to synthesize (p)ppGpp, which acts as a pleiotropic secondary messenger.</td>

            <td id=al>pfam02824 TGS domain. The TGS domain is named after ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT. Interestingly, TGS domain was detected also at the amino terminus of the uridine kinase from the spirochaete Treponema pallidum (but not any other organism, including the related spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi). TGS is a small domain that consists of ~50 amino acid residues and is predicted to possess a predominantly beta-sheet structure. There is no direct information on the functions of the TGS domain, but its presence in two types of regulatory proteins (the GTPases and guanosine polyphosphate phosphohydrolases/synthetases) suggests a ligand (most likely nucleotide)-binding, regulatory role.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04876 ACT  domain found C-terminal of the RelA/SpoT domains. ACT_RelA-SpoT: the ACT  domain found C-terminal of the RelA/SpoT domains. Enzymes of the Rel/Spo family enable bacteria to survive prolonged periods of nutrient limitation by controlling guanosine-3'-diphosphate-5'-(tri)diphosphate ((p)ppGpp) production and subsequent rRNA repression (stringent response). Both the synthesis of (p)ppGpp from ATP and GDP(GTP), and its hydrolysis to GDP(GTP) and pyrophosphate, are catalyzed by Rel/Spo proteins. In Escherichia coli and its close relatives, the metabolism of (p)ppGpp is governed by two homologous proteins, RelA and SpoT. The RelA protein catalyzes (p)ppGpp synthesis in a reaction requiring its binding to ribosomes bearing codon-specified uncharged tRNA. The major role of the SpoT protein is the breakdown of (p)ppGpp by a manganese-dependent (p)ppGpp pyrophosphohydrolase activity. Although the stringent response appears to be tightly regulated by these two enzymes in E. coli, a bifunctional Rel/Spo protein has been discovered in most gram-positive organisms studied so far. These bifunctional Rel/Spo homologs (rsh) appear to modulate (p)ppGpp levels through two distinct active sites that are controlled by a reciprocal regulatory mechanism ensuring inverse coupling of opposing activities. In studies with the Streptococcus equisimilis Rel/Spo homolog, the C-terminal domain appears to be involved in this reciprocal regulation of the two opposing catalytic activities present in the N-terminal domain, ensuring that both synthesis and degradation activities are not coinduced. Members of this CD belong to the superfamily of ACT regulatory domains.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01616 TGS (ThrRS, GTPase and SpoT) domain structurally similar to a beta-grasp ubiquitin-like fold. This family includes eukaryotic and some bacterial threonyl-tRNA synthetases (ThrRSs), a distinct Obg family GTPases, and guanosine polyphosphate hydrolase (SpoT) and synthetase (RelA), which are involved in stringent response in bacteria, as well as uridine kinase (UDK) from Thermotogales. All family members contain a TGS domain named after the ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT/RelA proteins where it occurs. It is a small domain with a beta-grasp ubiquitin-like fold, a common structure involved in protein-protein interactions. The functions of the TGS domain remains unclear, but its presence in two types of regulatory proteins (the GTPases and guanosine polyphosphate phosphohydrolases/synthetases) suggests a ligand (most likely nucleotide)-binding, with a regulatory role.</td>
