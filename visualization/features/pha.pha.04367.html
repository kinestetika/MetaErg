            <td id=al>The C-terminal substrate binding of LysR-type transcriptional regulator (CbbR) of RubisCO operon, which is involved in the carbon dioxide fixation, contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. CbbR, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, is required to activate expression of RubisCO, one of two unique enzymes in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle pathway. All plants, cyanobacteria, and many autotrophic bacteria use the CBB cycle to fix carbon dioxide. Thus, this cycle plays an essential role in assimilating CO2 into organic carbon on earth. The key CBB cycle enzyme is ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), which catalyzes the actual CO2 fixation reaction. The CO2 concentration affects the expression of RubisCO genes.  It has also shown that NADPH enhances the DNA-binding ability of the CbbR. RubisCO is composed of eight large (CbbL) and eight small subunits (CbbS).  The topology of this substrate-binding domain is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine. The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.</td>

            <td id=al>C-terminal substrate binding domain of LysR-type transcriptional regulator CysL, which activates the transcription of the cysJI operon encoding sulfite reductase, contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. CysL, also known as YwfK, is a regular of sulfur metabolism in Bacillus subtilis. Sulfur is required for the synthesis of proteins and essential cofactors in all living organism. Sulfur can be assimilated either from inorganic sources (sulfate and thiosulfate), or from organic sources (sulfate esters, sulfamates, and sulfonates). CysL activates the transcription of the cysJI operon encoding sulfite reductase, which reduces sulfite to sulfide. Both cysL mutant and cysJI mutant are unable to grow using sulfate or sulfite as the sulfur source. Like other LysR-type regulators, CysL also negatively regulates its own transcription. In Escherichia coli, three LysR-type activators are involved in the regulation of sulfur metabolism: CysB, Cbl and MetR.  The topology of this substrate-binding domain is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.

            <td id=al>The substrate binding domain of LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs), a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily. This model and hierarchy represent the the substrate-binding domain of the LysR-type transcriptional regulators that form the largest family of prokaryotic transcription factor. Homologs of some of LTTRs with similar domain organizations are also found in the archaea and eukaryotic organisms. The LTTRs are composed of two functional domains joined by a linker helix involved in oligomerization: an N-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain, which is responsible for the DNA-binding specificity, and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain, which is structurally homologous to the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins. As also observed in the periplasmic binding proteins, the C-terminal domain of the bacterial transcriptional repressor undergoes a conformational change upon substrate binding which in turn changes the DNA binding affinity of the repressor.  The genes controlled by the LTTRs have diverse functional roles including amino acid biosynthesis, CO2 fixation, antibiotic resistance, degradation of aromatic compounds, oxidative stress responses, nodule formation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, synthesis of virulence factors, toxin production, attachment and secretion, to name a few. The structural topology of this substrate-binding domain is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.

After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the substrate-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-like transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.</td>

            <td id=al>The C-terminal substrate-domain of LysR-type transcriptional regulators involved in the catabolism of opines and that of related regulators, contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This CD includes the C-terminal substrate-domain of LysR-type transcriptional regulators, OccR and NocR, involved in the catabolism of opines and that of LysR for lysine biosynthesis which clustered together in phylogenetic trees. Opines, such as octopine and nopaline, are low molecular weight compounds found in plant crown gall tumors that are produced by the parasitic bacterium Agrobacterium. There are at least 30 different opines identified so far. Opines are utilized by tumor-colonizing bacteria as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. NocR and OccR belong to the family of LysR-type transcriptional regulators that positively regulates the catabolism of nopaline and octopine, respectively. Both nopaline and octopalin are arginine derivatives. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, NocR regulates expression of the divergently transcribed nocB and nocR genes of the nopaline catabolism (noc) region.  OccR protein activates the occQ operon of the Ti plasmid in response to octopine. This operon encodes proteins required for the uptake and catabolism of octopine. The occ operon also encodes the TraR protein, which is a quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator of the Ti plasmid tra regulon.  LysR is the transcriptional activator of lysA gene encoding diaminopimelate decarboxylase, an enzyme that catalyses the decarboxylation of diaminopimelate to produce lysine. This substrate-binding domain shows significant homology to the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine. The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.

The expression of the nac gene is fully dependent on the nitrogen regulatory system (NTR) and the sigma54-containing RNA polymerase (sigma54-RNAP). In response to nitrogen starvation, NTR system activates the expression of nac, and NAC activates the expression of hut, ure, and put (proline utilization). NAC is not involved in the transcription of Sigma70-RNAP operons such as glnA, which directly respond by the NTR system, but activates the transcription of sigma70-RNAP dependent operons such as hut. Hence, NAC allows the coupling of sigma70-RNAP dependent operons to the sigma54-RNAP dependent NTR system.

The LTTRs are composed of two functional domains joined by a linker helix involved in oligomerization: an N-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain, which is responsible for the DNA-binding specificity, and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain, which is structurally homologous to the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins. As also observed in the periplasmic binding proteins, the C-terminal domain of the bacterial transcriptional repressor undergoes a conformational change upon substrate binding which in turn changes the DNA binding affinity of the repressor.  The genes controlled by the LTTRs have diverse functional roles including amino acid biosynthesis, CO2 fixation, antibiotic resistance, degradation of aromatic compounds, nodule formation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and synthesis of virulence factors, to a name a few.  This substrate-binding domain shows significant homology to the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine. The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.</td>

            <td id=al>The C-terminal substrate binding domain of LysR-type transcriptional regulators involved in the chlorocatechol catabolism, contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This CD includes the substrate binding domain of LysR-type regulators CbnR, ClcR and TfdR, which are involved in the regulation of chlorocatechol breakdown. The chlorocatechol-degradative pathway is often found in bacteria that can use chlorinated aromatic compounds as carbon and energy sources. CbnR is found in the 3-chlorobenzoate degradative bacterium Ralstonia eutropha NH9 and forms a tetramer. CbnR activates the expression of the cbnABCD genes, which are responsible for the degradation of chlorocatechol converted from 3-chlorobenzoate and are transcribed divergently from cbnR.   In soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida, the 3-chlorocatechol-degradative pathway is encoded by clcABD operon, which requires the divergently transcribed clcR for activation. TfdR is involved in the activation of tfdA and tfdB gene expression. These genes encode enzymes for the conversion of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenol. The topology of this substrate-binding domain is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine. The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.

In Escherichia coli, IlvY is required for the regulation of ilvC gene expression that encodes acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (AHIR), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, valine, and leucine). The ilvGMEDA operon genes encode remaining enzyme activities required for the biosynthesis of these amino acids. Activation of ilvC transcription by IlvY requires the additional binding of a co-inducer molecule (either alpha-acetolactate or alpha-acetohydoxybutyrate, the substrates for AHIR) to a preformed complex of IlvY protein-DNA.  Like many other LysR-family members, IlvY negatively auto-regulates the transcription of its own divergently transcribed ilvY gene in an inducer-independent manner.

CynR negatively regulates its own expression independently of cyanate. CynR binds to DNA and induces bending of DNA in the presence or absence of cyanate, but the amount of bending is decreased by cyanate.
