            <td id=al>cd03085 Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) catalyzes the bidirectional interconversion of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) via a glucose 1,6-diphosphate intermediate, an important metabolic step in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In one direction, G-1-P produced from sucrose catabolism is converted to G-6-P, the first intermediate in glycolysis. In the other direction, conversion of G-6-P to G-1-P generates a substrate for synthesis of UDP-glucose which is required for synthesis of a variety of cellular constituents including cell wall polymers and glycoproteins. The PGM1 family also includes a non-enzymatic PGM-related protein (PGM-RP) thought to play a structural role in eukaryotes, as well as pp63/parafusin, a phosphoglycoprotein that plays an important role in calcium-regulated exocytosis in ciliated protozoans. PGM1 belongs to the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily which includes several related enzymes that catalyze a reversible intramolecular phosphoryl transfer on their sugar substrates. Other members of this superfamily include phosphoglucosamine mutase (PNGM), phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PAGM), the bacterial phosphomannomutase ManB, the bacterial phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM, and the bifunctional phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM). Each of these enzymes has four domains with a centrally located active site formed by four loops, one from each domain. All four domains are included in this alignment model.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03089 The phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM) bifunctional enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of 1-phospho to 6-phospho-sugars (e.g. between mannose-1-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate or glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate) via a bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate. The reaction involves two phosphoryl transfers, with an intervening 180 degree reorientation of the reaction intermediate during catalysis. Reorientation of the intermediate occurs without dissociation from the active site of the enzyme and is thus, a simple example of processivity, as defined by multiple rounds of catalysis without release of substrate. Glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate are known to be utilized for energy metabolism and cell surface construction, respectively. PMM/PGM belongs to the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily which includes several related enzymes that catalyze a reversible intramolecular phosphoryl transfer on their sugar substrates. Other members of this superfamily include phosphoglucosamine mutase (PNGM), phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PAGM), the bacterial phosphomannomutase ManB, the bacterial phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM, and the phosphoglucomutases (PGM1 and PGM2).

            <td id=al>cd05802 GlmM is a bacterial phosphoglucosamine mutase (PNGM) that belongs to the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily. It is required for the interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate and glucosamine-1-phosphate in the biosynthetic pathway of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, an essential precursor to components of the cell envelope.  In order to be active, GlmM must be phosphorylated, which can occur via autophosphorylation or by the Ser/Thr kinase StkP. GlmM functions in a classical ping-pong bi-bi mechanism with glucosamine-1,6-diphosphate as an intermediate.  Other members of the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily include phosphoglucosamine mutase (PNGM), phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PAGM), the bacterial phosphomannomutase ManB, and the bifunctional phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM).
