            <td id=al>cd04170 Elongation factor G (EF-G) family. Translocation is mediated by EF-G (also called translocase). The structure of EF-G closely resembles that of the complex between EF-Tu and tRNA. This is an example of molecular mimicry; a protein domain evolved so that it mimics the shape of a tRNA molecule. EF-G in the GTP form binds to the ribosome, primarily through the interaction of its EF-Tu-like domain with the 50S subunit. The binding of EF-G to the ribosome in this manner stimulates the GTPase activity of EF-G. On GTP hydrolysis, EF-G undergoes a conformational change that forces its arm deeper into the A site on the 30S subunit. To accommodate this domain, the peptidyl-tRNA in the A site moves to the P site, carrying the mRNA and the deacylated tRNA with it. The ribosome may be prepared for these rearrangements by the initial binding of EF-G as well. The dissociation of EF-G leaves the ribosome ready to accept the next aminoacyl-tRNA into the A site. This group contains only bacterial members.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01434 EFG_mtEFG1_IV: domains similar to domain IV of the bacterial translational elongation factor (EF) EF-G.  Included in this group is a domain of mitochondrial Elongation factor G1 (mtEFG1) proteins homologous to domain IV of EF-G. Eukaryotic cells harbor 2 protein synthesis systems: one localized in the cytoplasm, the other in the mitochondria. Most factors regulating mitochondrial protein synthesis are encoded by nuclear genes, translated in the cytoplasm, and then transported to the mitochondria. The eukaryotic system of elongation factor (EF) components is more complex than that in prokaryotes, with both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial elongation factors and multiple isoforms being expressed in certain species. During the process of peptide synthesis and tRNA site changes, the ribosome is moved along the mRNA a distance equal to one codon with the addition of each amino acid. In bacteria this translocation step is catalyzed by EF-G_GTP, which is hydrolyzed to provide the required energy. Thus, this action releases the uncharged tRNA from the P site and transfers the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site. Eukaryotic mtEFG1 proteins show significant homology to bacterial EF-Gs.  Mutants in yeast mtEFG1 have impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, respiratory defects and a tendency to lose mitochondrial DNA. There are two forms of mtEFG present in mammals (designated mtEFG1s and mtEFG2s) mtEFG2s are not present in this group.</td>

            <td id=al>smart00889 Elongation factor G, domain IV. Translation elongation factors are responsible for two main processes during protein synthesis on the ribosome. EF1A (or EF-Tu) is responsible for the selection and binding of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site (acceptor site) of the ribosome. EF2 (or EF-G) is responsible for the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site (peptidyl-tRNA site) of the ribosome, thereby freeing the A-site for the next aminoacyl-tRNA to bind. Elongation factors are responsible for achieving accuracy of translation and both EF1A and EF2 are remarkably conserved throughout evolution. Elongation factor EF2 (EF-G) is a G-protein. It brings about the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA and mRNA through a ratchet-like mechanism: the binding of GTP-EF2 to the ribosome causes a counter-clockwise rotation in the small ribosomal subunit; the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by EF2 and the subsequent release of EF2 causes a clockwise rotation of the small subunit back to the starting position. This twisting action destabilises tRNA-ribosome interactions, freeing the tRNA to translocate along the ribosome upon GTP-hydrolysis by EF2. EF2 binding also affects the entry and exit channel openings for the mRNA, widening it when bound to enable the mRNA to translocate along the ribosome. EF2 has five domains. This entry represents domain IV found in EF2 (or EF-G) of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The EF2-GTP-ribosome complex undergoes extensive structural rearrangement for tRNA-mRNA movement to occur. Domain IV, which extends from the 'body' of the EF2 molecule much like a lever arm, appears to be essential for the structural transition to take place.</td>

This family includes the translational elongation factor termed EF-2 (for Archaea and Eukarya) and EF-G (for Bacteria), ribosomal protection proteins that mediate tetracycline resistance and, an evolutionarily conserved U5 snRNP-specific protein (U5-116kD). In complex with GTP, EF-G/EF-2  promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site of the small subunit of ribosome and the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. It has been shown that EF-G/EF-2_IV domain mimics the shape of anticodon arm of the tRNA in the structurally homologous ternary complex of Petra, EF-Tu (another transcriptional elongation factor) and GTP analog. The tip portion of this domain is found in a position that overlaps the anticodon arm of the A-site tRNA, implying that EF-G/EF-2 displaces the A-site tRNA to the P-site by physical interaction with the anticodon arm.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04169 Release Factor 3 (RF3) protein involved in the terminal step of translocation in bacteria. Peptide chain release factor 3 (RF3) is a protein involved in the termination step of translation in bacteria. Termination occurs when class I release factors (RF1 or RF2) recognize the stop codon at the A-site of the ribosome and activate the release of the nascent polypeptide. The class II release factor RF3 then initiates the release of the class I RF from the ribosome. RF3 binds to the RF/ribosome complex in the inactive (GDP-bound) state. GDP/GTP exchange occurs, followed by the release of the class I RF. Subsequent hydrolysis of GTP to GDP triggers the release of RF3 from the ribosome. RF3 also enhances the efficiency of class I RFs at less preferred stop codons and at stop codons in weak contexts.</td>

This domain includes the carboxyl terminal regions of elongation factors (EFs) bacterial EF-G, eukaryotic and archeal EF-2 and eukaryotic mitochondrial mtEFG1s and mtEFG2s. This group also includes proteins similar to the ribosomal protection proteins Tet(M) and Tet(O), BipA, LepA and, spliceosomal proteins: human 116kD U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) protein (U5-116 kD) and yeast counterpart Snu114p.  This domain adopts a ferredoxin-like fold consisting of an alpha-beta sandwich with anti-parallel beta-sheets, resembling the topology of domain III found in the elongation factors EF-G and eukaryotic EF-2, with which it forms the C-terminal block. The two domains however are not superimposable and domain III lacks some of the characteristics of this domain.  EF-2/EF-G in complex with GTP, promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site, the uncharged tRNA from the P site to the E-site and, the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. Tet(M) and Tet(O) mediate Tc resistance. Typical Tcs bind to the ribosome and inhibit the elongation phase of protein synthesis, by inhibiting the occupation of site A by aminoacyl-tRNA. Tet(M) and Tet(O) catalyze the release of tetracycline (Tc) from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner.  BipA is a highly conserved protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia coli. Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability and for splicing in vivo. Experiments suggest that GTP binding and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p. The function of LepA proteins is unknown.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01684 EF-G_domain IV_RPP domain is a part of bacterial ribosomal protected proteins (RPP) family. RPPs such as tetracycline resistance proteins Tet(M) and Tet(O) mediate tetracycline resistance in both gram-positive and -negative species. Tetracyclines inhibit the accommodation of aminoacyl-tRNA into ribosomal A site and therefore prevent the addition of new amino acids to the growing polypeptide. RPPs Tet(M) confer tetracycline resistance by releasing tetracycline from the ribosome and thereby freeing the ribosome from inhibitory effects of the drug, such that aa-tRNA can bind to the A site and protein synthesis can continue.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04088 Domain II of bacterial elongation factor G and C-terminal domain of mitochondrial Elongation factors G1 and G2. This family represents the domain II of bacterial Elongation factor G (EF-G)and mitochondrial Elongation factors G1 (mtEFG1) and G2 (mtEFG2). During the process of peptide synthesis and tRNA site changes, the ribosome is moved along the mRNA a distance equal to one codon with the addition of each amino acid. In bacteria this translocation step is catalyzed by EF-G_GTP, which is hydrolyzed to provide the required energy. Thus, this action releases the uncharged tRNA from the P site and transfers the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site. Eukaryotic cells harbor 2 protein synthesis systems: one localized in the cytoplasm, the other in the mitochondria. Most factors regulating mitochondrial protein synthesis are encoded by nuclear genes, translated in the cytoplasm, and then transported to the mitochondria. The eukaryotic system of elongation factor (EF) components is more complex than that in prokaryotes, with both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial elongation factors and multiple isoforms being expressed in certain species. mtEFG1 and mtEFG2 show significant homology to bacterial EF-Gs. Mutants in yeast mtEFG1 have impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, respiratory defects and a tendency to lose mitochondrial DNA. No clear phenotype has been found for mutants in the yeast homolog of mtEFG2, MEF2.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16257 Domain III of Elongation factor G (EF-G) and related proteins. Bacterial Elongation factor G (EF-G) and related proteins play a role in translation and share a similar domain architecture. Elongation factor EFG participates in the elongation phase during protein biosynthesis on the ribosome by stimulating translocation. Its functional cycles depend on GTP binding and its hydrolysis. Domain III is involved in the activation of GTP hydrolysis. This domain III, which is different from domain III in EF-TU and related elongation factors, is found in several translation factors, like bacterial release factors RF3, elongation factor 4, elongation factor 2, GTP-binding protein BipA and tetracycline resistance protein Tet.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01342 Domain II of Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu)-like proteins. Elongation factor Tu consists of three structural domains. Domain II adopts a beta barrel structure and is involved in binding to charged tRNA. Domain II is found in other proteins such as elongation factor G and translation initiation factor IF-2. This group also includes the C2 subdomain of domain IV of IF-2 that has the same fold as domain II of (EF-Tu). Like IF-2 from certain prokaryotes such as Thermus thermophilus, mitochondrial IF-2 lacks domain II, which is thought  to be involved in binding of E. coli IF-2 to 30S subunits.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00882 Rat sarcoma (Ras)-like superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Ras-like GTPase superfamily. The Ras-like superfamily of small GTPases consists of several families with an extremely high degree of structural and functional similarity. The Ras superfamily is divided into at least four families in eukaryotes: the Ras, Rho, Rab, and Sar1/Arf families. This superfamily also includes proteins like the GTP translation factors, Era-like GTPases, and G-alpha chain of the heterotrimeric G proteins. Members of the Ras superfamily regulate a wide variety of cellular functions: the Ras family regulates gene expression, the Rho family regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression, the Rab and Sar1/Arf families regulate vesicle trafficking, and the Ran family regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport and microtubule organization. The GTP translation factor family regulates initiation, elongation, termination, and release in translation, and the Era-like GTPase family regulates cell division, sporulation, and DNA replication. Members of the Ras superfamily are identified by the GTP binding site, which is made up of five characteristic sequence motifs, and the switch I and switch II regions.</td>

Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability and for splicing in vivo. U5-116 kD binds GTP.  Experiments suggest that GTP binding and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p.   In complex with GTP, EF-2 promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site, the uncharged tRNA from the P site to the E-site and, the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome.</td>
