The NAD+ binding domain is inserted within the linear sequence of the mostly N-terminal catalytic domain, which has a similar domain structure to the internal NAD binding domain. Structurally, these domains are connected by extended alpha helices and create a cleft in which NAD is bound, primarily to the C-terminal portion of the 2nd (internal) domain.

            <td id=al>Formate/glycerate and related dehydrogenases of the D-specific 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase family. Formate dehydrogenase, D-specific 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase, Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase, Lactate dehydrogenase, Thermostable Phosphite Dehydrogenase, and Hydroxy(phenyl)pyruvate reductase, among others, share a characteristic arrangement of 2 similar subdomains of the alpha/beta Rossmann fold NAD+ binding form. 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the conversion of a wide variety of D-2-hydroxy acids to their corresponding keto acids. The general mechanism is (R)-lactate + acceptor to pyruvate + reduced acceptor. The NAD+ binding domain is inserted within the linear sequence of the mostly N-terminal catalytic domain, which has a similar domain structure to the internal NAD binding domain. Structurally, these domains are connected by extended alpha helices and create a cleft in which NAD is bound, primarily to the C-terminal portion of the 2nd (internal) domain. Some related proteins have similar structural subdomain but with a tandem arrangement of the catalytic and NAD-binding subdomains in the linear sequence. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of formate ion to carbon dioxide with the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. FDHs of this family contain no metal ions or prosthetic groups. Catalysis occurs though direct transfer of hydride ion to NAD+ without the stages of acid-base catalysis typically found in related dehydrogenases. FDHs are found in all methylotrophic microorganisms in energy production and in the stress responses of plants. Formate/glycerate and related dehydrogenases of the D-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase superfamily include groups such as formate dehydrogenase, glycerate dehydrogenase, L-alanine dehydrogenase, and S-Adenosylhomocysteine Hydrolase, among others. While many members of this family are dimeric, alanine DH is hexameric and phosphoglycerate DH is tetrameric.</td>

CtBP was initially identified as a protein that bound the PXDLS sequence at the adenovirus E1A C terminus, causing the loss of CR-1-mediated transactivation.

            <td id=al>D-glycerate dehydrogenase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GDH). D-glycerate dehydrogenase (GDH, also known as hydroxypyruvate reductase, HPR) catalyzes the reversible reaction of (R)-glycerate + NAD+ to hydroxypyruvate + NADH + H+. In humans, HPR deficiency causes primary hyperoxaluria type 2, characterized by over-excretion of L-glycerate and oxalate in the urine, possibly due to an imbalance in competition with L-lactate dehydrogenase, another formate dehydrogenase (FDH)-like enzyme. GDH, like FDH and other members of the D-specific hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family that also includes L-alanine dehydrogenase and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, typically have a characteristic arrangement of 2 similar subdomains of the alpha/beta Rossmann-fold NAD+ binding form, despite often low sequence identity.

The NAD+ binding domain is inserted within the linear sequence of the mostly N-terminal catalytic domain, which has a similar domain structure to the internal NAD binding domain. Structurally, these domains are connected by extended alpha helices and create a cleft in which NAD is bound, primarily to the C-terminal portion of the 2nd (internal) domain. Some related proteins have similar structural subdomain but with a tandem arrangement of the catalytic and NAD-binding subdomains in the linear sequence.

D-Erythronate-4-phosphate Dehydrogenase (E. coli gene PdxB), a D-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family member, catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of erythronate-4-phosphate, which is followed by transamination to form 4-hydroxy-L-threonine-4-phosphate within the de novo biosynthesis pathway of vitamin B6. D-Erythronate-4-phosphate dehydrogenase has the common architecture shared with D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases but contains an additional C-terminal dimerization domain in addition to an NAD-binding domain and the "lid" domain. The lid domain corresponds to the catalytic domain of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and other proteins of the D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, which include groups such as formate dehydrogenase, glycerate dehydrogenase, L-alanine dehydrogenase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. Despite often low sequence identity, these proteins typically have a characteristic arrangement of 2 similar subdomains of the alpha/beta Rossmann fold NAD+ binding form. The NAD+ binding domain is inserted within the linear sequence of the mostly N-terminal catalytic domain, which has a similar domain structure to the internal NAD binding domain. Structurally, these domains are connected by extended alpha helices and create a cleft in which NAD is bound, primarily to the C-terminal portion of the 2nd (internal) domain. Some related proteins have similar structural subdomain but with a tandem arrangement of the catalytic and NAD-binding subdomains in the linear sequence.</td>

The C-terminal ACT (regulatory) domain of D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3PGDH), with an extended C-terminal (xct) region from bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants. 3PGDH is an enzyme that belongs to the D-isomer specific, 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family and catalyzes the oxidation of D-3-phosphoglycerate to 3- phosphohydroxypyruvate, which is the first step in the biosynthesis of L-serine, using NAD+ as the oxidizing agent. In bacteria, 3PGDH is feedback-controlled by the end product L-serine in an allosteric manner. Some 3PGDH enzymes have an additional domain formed by an extended C-terminal region. This additional domain introduces significant asymmetry to the homotetramer. Adjacent ACT (regulatory) domains interact, creating two serine-binding sites, however, this asymmetric arrangement results in the formation of two different and distinct domain interfaces between identical domains in the asymmetric unit. How this asymmetry influences the mechanism of effector inhibition is still unknown. Members of this CD belong to the superfamily of ACT regulatory domains.</td>

In the Escherichia coli homotetrameric enzyme, the interface at adjacent ACT (regulatory) domains couples to create an extended beta-sheet. Each regulatory interface forms two serine-binding sites. The mechanism by which serine transmits inhibition to the active site is postulated to involve the tethering of the regulatory domains together to create a rigid quaternary structure with a solvent-exposed active site cleft. This CD also includes the C-terminal ACT domain of the L-serine dehydratase (LSD), iron-sulfur-dependent, beta subunit, found in various bacterial anaerobes such as Clostridium, Bacillus, and Treponema species. LSD enzymes catalyze the deamination of L-serine, producing pyruvate and ammonia. Unlike the eukaryotic L-serine dehydratase, which requires the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor, the prokaryotic L-serine dehydratase contains an [4Fe-4S] cluster instead of a PLP active site.
