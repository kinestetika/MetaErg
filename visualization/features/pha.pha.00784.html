This feature may be key and implies that this could be a criterion for degrading a protein. In Oenococcus oeni FtsH is involved in protection against environmental stress, and shows increased expression under heat or osmotic stress. These two lines of evidence suggest that it is a fundamental prokaryotic self-protection mechanism that checks if proteins are correctly folded (personal obs: Yeats C). The precise function of this N-terminal region is unclear.</td>
