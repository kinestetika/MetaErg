            <td id=al>phosphoprotein phosphatases of the metallophosphatase superfamily, metallophosphatase domain. The PPP (phosphoprotein phosphatase) family is one of two known protein phosphatase families specific for serine and threonine.  This family includes: PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), PP4, PP5, PP6, PP7, Bsu1, RdgC, PrpE, PrpA/PrpB, and ApA4 hydrolase. The PPP catalytic domain is defined by three conserved motifs (-GDXHG-, -GDXVDRG- and -GNHE-).  The PPP enzyme family is ancient with members found in all eukaryotes, and in most bacterial and archeal genomes.  Dephosphorylation of phosphoserines and phosphothreonines on target proteins plays a central role in the regulation of many cellular processes.  PPPs belong to the metallophosphatase (MPP) superfamily.  MPPs are functionally diverse, but all share a conserved domain with an active site consisting of two metal ions (usually manganese, iron, or zinc) coordinated with octahedral geometry by a cage of histidine, aspartate, and asparagine residues. The MPP superfamily includes: Mre11/SbcD-like exonucleases, Dbr1-like RNA lariat debranching enzymes, YfcE-like phosphodiesterases, purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), YbbF-like UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolases, and acid sphingomyelinases (ASMases).  The conserved domain is a double beta-sheet sandwich with a di-metal active site made up of residues located at the C-terminal side of the sheets.  This domain is thought to allow for productive metal coordination.</td>

            <td id=al>Bacillus subtilis PrpE and related proteins, metallophosphatase domain. PrpE (protein phosphatase E) is a bacterial member of the PPP (phosphoprotein phosphatase) family of serine/threonine phosphatases and a key signal transduction pathway component controlling the expression of spore germination receptors GerA and GerK in Bacillus subtilis. PrpE is closely related to ApaH (also known symmetrical Ap(4)A hydrolase and bis(5'nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase).  PrpE has specificity for phosphotyrosine only, unlike the serine/threonine phosphatases to which it is related. The Bacilli members of this family are single domain proteins while the other members have N- and C-terminal domains in addition to this phosphatase domain. Pnkp is the end-healing and end-sealing component of an RNA repair system present in bacteria. It is composed of three catalytic modules: an N-terminal polynucleotide 5' kinase, a central 2',3' phosphatase, and a C-terminal ligase. Pnkp is a Mn(2+)-dependent phosphodiesterase-monoesterase that dephosphorylates 2',3'-cyclic phosphate RNA ends. An RNA binding site is suggested by a continuous tract of positive surface potential flanking the active site. The PPP (phosphoprotein phosphatase) family, to which PrpE belongs, is one of two known protein phosphatase families specific for serine and threonine.  The PPP family also includes: PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), PP4, PP5, PP6, PP7, Bsu1, RdgC, PrpA/PrpB, and ApA4 hydrolase.

CAPTPase is an uncharacterized protein that belongs to the Shelph (Shewanella-like phosphatase) family of PPP (phosphoprotein phosphatases).  The PPP family is one of two known protein phosphatase families specific for serine and threonine.  In addition to Shelps, the PPP family also includes: PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), PP4, PP5, PP6, PP7, Bsu1, RdgC, PrpE, PrpA/PrpB, and ApA4 hydrolase.

            <td id=al>Escherichia coli ApaH and related proteins, metallophosphatase domain. ApaH (also known as symmetrically cleaving Ap4A hydrolase and bis(5'nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase) is a bacterial member of the PPP (phosphoprotein phosphatase) family of serine/threonine phosphatases that hydrolyzes the nucleotide-signaling molecule diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap(4)A) into two ADP and also hydrolyzes Ap(5)A, Gp(4)G, and other extending compounds.  Null mutations in apaH result in high intracellular levels of Ap(4)A which correlate with multiple phenotypes, including a decreased expression of catabolite-repressible genes, a reduction in the expression of flagellar operons, and an increased sensitivity to UV  and heat.  Ap4A hydrolase is important in responding to heat shock and oxidative stress via regulating the concentration of Ap4A in bacteria.  Ap4A hydrolase is also thought to play a role in siderophore production, but the mechanism by which ApaH interacts with siderophore pathways in unknown.  The PPP (phosphoprotein phosphatase) family, to which ApaH belongs, is one of two known protein phosphatase families specific for serine and threonine.  The PPP family also includes: PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), PP4, PP5, PP6, PP7, Bsu1, RdgC, PrpE, and PrpA/PrpB.

            <td id=al>PP2B, metallophosphatase domain. PP2B (calcineurin) is a unique serine/threonine protein phosphatase in its regulation by a second messenger (calcium and calmodulin).  PP2B is involved in many biological processes including immune responses, the second messenger cAMP pathway, sodium/potassium ion transport in the nephron, cell cycle progression in lower eukaryotes, cardiac hypertrophy, and memory formation.  PP2B is highly conserved from yeast to humans, but is absent from plants.  PP2B is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (CnA) and a regulatory subunit (CnB); CnB  contains four Ca2+ binding motifs referred to as EF hands.  The PPP (phosphoprotein phosphatase) family, to which PP2B belongs, is one of two known protein phosphatase families specific for serine and threonine.
