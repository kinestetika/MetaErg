            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CKI1 and Escherichia coli RcsC. This family is composed of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators that are sensor histidine kinases (HKs) fused with a REC domain, similar to the sensor histidine kinase CKI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) signaling that mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. MSP involves a signal being transferred from HKs via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. The CKI1 REC domain specifically interacts with the downstream signaling protein AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. The plant MSP system has evolved from the prokaryotic two-component system (TCS), which allows organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. This family also includes bacterial hybrid sensor HKs such as Escherichia coli RcsC, which is a component of the Rcs signalling pathway that controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division, and motility. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

This model represents the second REC domain and similar domains. DhkD activates the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA to ensure proper prestalk and prespore patterning, tip formation, and the vertical elongation of the mound into a finger, in Dictyostelium discoideum.

PA4781 is involved in cyclic di-3',5'-GMP (c-di-GMP) hydrolysis/degradation in a two-step reaction via the linear intermediate pGpG to produce GMP. Its unphosphorylated REC domain prevents accessibility of c-di-GMP to the active site.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of response regulators (RRs) and pseudo response regulators (PRRs). Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

Cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase response regulator RpfG, together with sensory/regulatory protein RpfC, constitute a two-component system implicated in sensing and responding to the diffusible signal factor (DSF) that is essential for cell-cell signaling. RpfC is a hybrid sensor/histidine kinase that phosphorylates and activates RpfG, which degrades cyclic di-GMP to GMP, leading to the activation of Clp, a global transcriptional regulator that regulates a large set of genes in the DSF pathway. RpfG contains a CheY-like receiver domain attached to a histidine-aspartic acid-glycine-tyrosine-proline (HD-GYP) cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase domain.

This family includes FilI, the histidine kinase (HK) component of FilI-FilRs, a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanosaeta harundinacea, which is involved in regulating methanogenesis. The cytoplasmic HK core consists of a C-terminal HK-like ATPase domain (represented here) and a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA) domain, which, in FilI, are coupled to CHASE, HAMP, PAS, and GAF sensor domains. FilI-FilRs catalyzes the phosphotransfer between FilI (HK) and FilRs (FilR1 and FilR2, response regulators) of the TCS. TCSs are predicted to be of bacterial origin, and acquired by archaea by horizontal gene transfer. This model also includes related HATPase domains such as that of Synechocystis sp.

They directly regulate the expression of type-A ARR genes and other downstream target genes. Cytokinin is a plant hormone implicated in many growth and development processes including shoot organogenesis, leaf senescence, sink/source relationships, vascular development, lateral bud release, and photomorphogenic development. Cytokinin signaling involves a phosphorelay cascade by histidine kinase receptors (AHKs), histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) and downstream ARRs. ARRs are divided into two groups, type-A and -B, according to their sequence and domain structure. Type-B ARRs contain a receiver (REC) domain and a large C-terminal extension that has characteristics of an effector or output domain, with a Myb-like DNA binding domain referred to as the GARP domain. The GARP domain is a motif specific to plant transcription factors. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of plant ethylene receptors ETR1, ETR2, and EIN4, and similar proteins. Plant ethylene receptors contain N-terminal transmembrane domains that contain an ethylene binding site and also serve in localization of the receptor to the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus and a C-terminal histidine kinase (HK)-like domain. There are five ethylene receptors (ETR1, ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4) in Arabidopsis thaliana. ETR1, ETR2, and EIN4 also contain REC domains C-terminal to the HK domain. ETR1 and ERS1 belong to subfamily 1, and have functional HK domains while ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 belong to subfamily 2, and lack the necessary residues for HK activity and may function as serine/threonine kinases. The plant hormone ethylene plays an important role in plant growth and development. It regulates seed germination, seedling growth, leaf and petal abscission, fruit ripening, organ senescence, and pathogen responses. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

Members of the LytTR/AlgR family of response regulators contain a REC domain and a unique LytTR DNA-binding output domain that lacks the helix-turn-helix motif and consists mostly of beta-strands. Transcriptional regulators with the LytTR-type output domains are involved in biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, fimbriation, expression of exoproteins, including toxins, and quorum sensing.

LytR and LytT are components of regulatory systems that regulate genes involved in cell wall metabolism. AlgR positively regulates the algD gene, which codes for a GDP-mannose dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the alginate biosynthesis pathway.

Type-A response regulators of Arabidopsis (ARRs) are involved in cytokinin signaling, which involves a phosphorelay cascade by histidine kinase receptors (AHKs), histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) and downstream ARRs. Cytokinin is a plant hormone implicated in many growth and development processes including shoot organogenesis, leaf senescence, sink/source relationships, vascular development, lateral bud release, and photomorphogenic development. Type-A ARRs function downstream of and are regulated by type-B ARRs, which are a class of MYB-type transcription factors. As primary cytokinin response genes, type-A ARRs act as redundant negative feedback regulators of cytokinin signaling by inactivating the phosphorelay. ARRs are divided into two groups, type-A and -B, according to their sequence and domain structure. Type-A ARRs are similar in domain structure to CheY, in that they lack a typical output domain and only contain a stand-alone receiver (REC) domain.

            <td id=al>pseudo receiver domain of pseudo-response regulators. In Arabidopsis, five pseudo-response regulators (PRRs), also called APRRs, comprise a core group of clock components that controls the pace of the central oscillator of the circadian clock, an endogenous time-keeping mechanism that enables organisms to adapt to external daily cycles. The coordinated sequential expression of PRR9 (APRR9), PRR7 (APRR7), PRR5 (APRR5), PRR3 (APRR3), and PRR1 (APRR1) results in circadian waves that may be at the basis of the endogenous circadian clock. PRRs contain an N-terminal pseudo receiver (psREC) domain that resembles the receiver domain of a two-component response regulator, but lacks an aspartate residue that accepts a phosphoryl group from the sensor kinase, and a CCT motif at the C-terminus that contains a putative nuclear localization signal. The psREC domain is involved in protein-protein interactions.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hydrogen uptake protein regulator (HupR) and similar domains. This family is composed of mostly uncharacterized response regulators with similarity to the REC domains of response regulator components of two-component systems that regulates hydrogenase activity, including HupR and HoxA. HupR is part of the HupT/HupR system that controls the synthesis of the membrane-bound [NiFe]hydrogenase, HupSL, of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. It contains an N-terminal REC domain, a central sigma-54 interaction domain that lacks ATPase activity, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Members of this family contain a REC domain and various output domains including the cyclase homology domain (CHD) and the c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase domains, HD-GYP and EAL. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of Rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and similar NtrC family response regulators. NtrC family proteins are transcriptional regulators that have REC, AAA+ ATPase/sigma-54 interaction, and DNA-binding output domains. This subfamily of NtrC proteins include NtrC, also called nitrogen regulator I (NRI), from Rhodobacter capsulatus, Azospirillum brasilense, and Azorhizobium caulinodans. NtrC is part of the NtrB/NtrC two-component system that controls the expression of the nitrogen-regulated (ntr) genes in response to nitrogen limitation. The N-terminal REC domain of NtrC proteins regulate the activity of the protein and its phosphorylation controls the AAA+ domain oligomerization, while the central AAA+ domain participates in nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, oligomerization, and sigma54 interaction. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoQ and Providencia stuartii AarG. This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoQ and Providencia stuartii AarG. PhoQ is the histidine kinase (HK) of the PhoP-PhoQ two-component regulatory system (TCS), which responds to the levels of Mg2+ and Ca2+, controls virulence, mediates the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments, and regulates numerous cellular activities. Providencia stuartii AarG is a putative sensor kinase which controls the expression of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase and an intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) response in Providencia stuartii. The AarG product is similar to PhoQ in that it is able to restore wild-type levels of resistance to a Salmonella typhimurium phoQ mutant. However, the expression of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase gene and of aarP (a gene encoding a transcriptional activator of 2'-N-acetyltransferase) are not significantly affected by the levels of Mg2+ or Ca2+. Most proteins in this group contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA); some have an accessory HAMP sensor domain, and some have an intracellular membrane -interaction PhoQ sensor domain.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of Brucella abortus CpdR and CckA, and similar domains. Two-component systems (TCSs), consisting of a sensor and a response regulator, are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by TCSs in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis and membrane transport. Response regulators share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and differ output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand, and protein-binding, or enzymatic domain. CpdR is a stand-alone REC protein. CckA is a sensor histidine kinase containing N-terminal PAS domains and a C-terminal REC domain. CpdR and CckA are components of a regulatory phosphorelay system (composed of CckA, ChpT, CtrA and CpdR) that controls Brucella abortus cell growth, division, and intracellular survival inside mammalian host cells. CckA autophosphorylates in the presence of ATP and transfers a phosphoryl group to the conserved aspartic acid residue on its C-terminal REC domain, which is relayed to the ChpT phosphotransferase. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>REC-like adaptor domain (D2) of response regulator PleD. PleD contains a REC domain (D1) with the phosphorylatable aspartate, a pseudo receiver (psREC)-like adaptor domain (D2), and the enzymatic diguanylate cyclase (DGC) domain, also called the GGDEF domain according to a conserved sequence motif, as its output domain. The GGDEF-containing PleD response regulators are global regulators of cell metabolism in some important human pathogens. This model describes the REC-like adaptor domain D2 of PleD, which is an inactive domain.</td>
