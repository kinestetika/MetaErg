            <td id=al>PAP-phosphatase_like domains. PAP-phosphatase is a member of the inositol monophosphatase family, and catalyses the hydrolysis of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate (PAP) to AMP. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HAL2 (MET22) is involved in methionine biosynthesis and provides increased salt tolerance when over-expressed. Bacterial members of this domain family may differ in their substrate specificity and dephosphorylate different targets, as the substrate binding site does not appear to be conserved in that sub-set.</td>

            <td id=al>3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase, HAL2 family. Sulfate is incorporated into 3-phosphoadenylylsulfate, PAPS, for utilization in pathways such as methionine biosynthesis. Transfer of sulfate from PAPS to an acceptor leaves adenosine 3'-5'-bisphosphate, APS. This model describes a form found in plants of the enzyme 3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase, which removes the 3'-phosphate from APS to regenerate AMP and help drive the cycle. Sensitivity of this essential enzyme to sodium and other metal ions results is responsible for characterization of this enzyme as a salt tolerance protein. Some members of this family are active also as inositol 1-monophosphatase.</td>

            <td id=al>IMPase, inositol monophosphatase and related domains. A family of Mg++ dependent phosphatases, inhibited by lithium, many of which may act on inositol monophosphate substrate. They dephosphorylate inositol phosphate to generate inositol, which may be recycled into inositol lipids; in eukaryotes IMPase plays a vital role in intracellular signaling. IMPase is one of the proposed targets of Li+ therapy in manic-depressive illness. This family contains some bacterial members of the inositol monophosphatase family classified as SuhB-like. E. coli SuhB has been suggested to participate in posstranscriptional control of gene expression, and its inositol monophosphatase activity doesn't appear to be sufficient for its cellular function. It has been proposed, that SuhB plays a role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol in mycobacteria.</td>
