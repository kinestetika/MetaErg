These enzymes enable microorganisms to tolerate and even exclusively utilize aromatic compounds for growth. ROs consist of two or three components: reductase, oxygenase, and ferredoxin (in some cases) components. The oxygenase component may contain alpha and beta subunits, with the beta subunit having a purely structural function. Some oxygenase components contain only an alpha subunit. The oxygenase alpha subunit has two domains, an N-terminal Rieske domain with an [2Fe-2S] cluster and a C-terminal catalytic domain with a mononuclear Fe(II) binding site. The Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster accepts electrons from the reductase or ferredoxin component and transfers them to the mononuclear iron for catalysis. Reduced pyridine nucleotide is used as the initial source of two electrons for dioxygen activation.</td>

ROs comprise a large class of aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases that enable microorganisms to tolerate and utilize aromatic compounds for growth. The oxygenase alpha subunit contains an N-terminal Rieske domain with an [2Fe-2S] cluster and a C-terminal catalytic domain with a mononuclear Fe(II) binding site. The Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster accepts electrons from a reductase or ferredoxin component and transfers them to the mononuclear iron for catalysis. PhDO and CBDO are two-component RO systems, containing oxygenase and reductase components. PhDO catalyzes the dihydroxylation of phthalate to form the 4,5-dihydro-cis-dihydrodiol of phthalate (DHD). CBDO, together with CbaC dehydrogenase, converts the environmental pollutant 3CBA to protocatechuate (PCA) and 5-Cl-PCA, which are then metabolized by the chromosomal PCA meta (extradiol) ring fission pathway. POB-dioxygenase catalyzes the initial catabolic step in the angular dioxygenation of phenoxybenzoate, converting mono- and dichlorinated phenoxybenzoates to protocatechuate and chlorophenols. These phenoxybenzoates are metabolic products formed during the degradation of pyrethroid insecticides.</td>

The Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster accepts electrons from a reductase or ferredoxin component and transfers them to the mononuclear iron for catalysis. Vanillate-O-demethylase is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of a terminal oxygenase (VanA) and reductase (VanB) components. This enzyme reductively catalyzes the conversion of vanillate into protocatechuate and formaldehyde. Protocatechuate and vanillate are important intermediate metabolites in the degradation pathway of lignin-derived compounds such as ferulic acid and vanillin by soil microbes.  DDmC is the oxygenase component of a three-component dicamba O-demethylase found in Pseudomonas maltophila, that catalyzes the conversion of a widely used herbicide called herbicide dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) to DCSA (3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid).</td>

The Rieske domain can be divided into two subdomains, with an incomplete six-stranded, antiparallel beta-barrel at one end, and an iron-sulfur cluster binding subdomain at the other. The Rieske iron-sulfur center contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is involved in electron transfer, and is liganded to two histidine and two cysteine residues present in conserved sequences called Rieske motifs. In RO systems, the N-terminal Rieske domain of the alpha subunit acts as an electron shuttle that accepts electrons from a reductase or ferredoxin component and transfers them to the mononuclear iron in the alpha subunit C-terminal domain to be used for catalysis.</td>

PrnD is a novel Rieske N-oxygenase that catalyzes the final step in the pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic pathway, the oxidation of the amino group in aminopyrrolnitrin to a nitro group, forming the antibiotic pyrrolnitrin. The biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin is one of the best examples of enzyme-catalyzed arylamine oxidation. Although arylamine oxygenases are widely distributed within the microbial world and used in a variety of metabolic reactions, PrnD represents one of only two known examples of arylamine oxygenases or N-oxygenases involved in arylnitro group formation, the other being AurF involved in aureothin biosynthesis.</td>

The Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster accepts electrons from a reductase or ferredoxin component and transfers them to the mononuclear iron for catalysis. OMO catalyzes the NADH-dependent oxidation of the N-heterocyclic aromatic compound 2-oxoquinoline to 8-hydroxy-2-oxoquinoline, the second step in the bacterial degradation of quinoline. OMO consists of a reductase component (OMR) and  an oxygenase component (OMO) that together function to shuttle electrons from the reduced pyridine nucleotide to the active site of OMO, where O2 activation and 2-oxoquinoline hydroxylation occurs. CARDO, which contains oxygenase (CARDO-O), ferredoxin (CARDO-F) and ferredoxin reductase (CARDO-R) components, catalyzes the dihydroxylation at the C1 and C9a positions of carbazole. The oxygenase component of OMO and CARDO contain only alpha subunits arranged in a trimeric structure.</td>

The RO family comprise a large class of aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases found predominantly in microorganisms. These enzymes enable microorganisms to tolerate and even exclusively utilize aromatic compounds for growth. ROs consist of two or three components: reductase, oxygenase, and ferredoxin (in some cases) components. The ferredoxin component contains either a plant-type or Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster. The Rieske ferredoxin component in this family carries an electron from the RO reductase component to the terminal RO oxygenase component. BPDO degrades biphenyls and polychlorinated biphenyls. BPDO ferredoxin (BphF) has structural features consistent with a minimal and perhaps archetypical Rieske protein in that the insertions that give other Rieske proteins unique structural features are missing. CARDO catalyzes dihydroxylation at the C1 and C9a positions of carbazole. Rieske ferredoxins are found as subunits of membrane oxidase complexes, cis-dihydrodiol-forming aromatic dioxygenases, bacterial assimilatory nitrite reductases, and arsenite oxidase. Rieske ferredoxins are also found as soluble electron carriers in bacterial dioxygenase and monooxygenase complexes.</td>
