This subgroup includes TRAP transporters that bind to ketoacids such as pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate, xylulose, and other unknown ligands. TRAP transporters are a large family of solute transporters ubiquitously found in bacteria and archaea. They are comprised of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (SBP; often called the P subunit) and two unequally sized integral membrane components: a large transmembrane subunit involved in the translocation process (the M subunit) and a smaller membrane of unknown function (the Q subunit). The driving force of TRAP transporters is provided by electrochemical ion gradients (either protons or sodium ions) across the cytoplasmic membrane, rather than ATP hydrolysis. This substrate-binding domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily (PBP2). The PBP2 proteins are typically comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>

The structure of the SiaP receptor has revealed an overall topology similar to ATP binding cassette ESR (extracytoplasmic solute receptors) proteins. Upon binding of sialic acid, SiaP undergoes domain closure about a hinge region and kinking of an alpha-helix hinge component.</td>

            <td id=al>cd13672 Substrate-binding domain of a sialic acid binding Tripartite ATP-independent  Periplasmic transport system (SiaP); the type 2 periplasmic-binding protein fold. This subfamily represents the periplasmic-binding component of TRAP transport system SiaP, a sialic acid binding virulence factor. TRAP transporters are a large family of solute transporters ubiquitously found in bacteria and archaea. They are comprised of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (SBP) and two unequally sized integral membrane components: a large transmembrane subunit involved in the translocation process and a smaller membrane of unknown function. The driving force of TRAP transporters is provided by electrochemical ion gradients (either protons or sodium ions) across the cytoplasmic membrane, rather than ATP hydrolysis. This substrate-binding domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily (PBP2). The PBP2 proteins are typically comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>
