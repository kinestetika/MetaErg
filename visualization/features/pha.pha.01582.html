            <td id=al>cd11646 Precorrin-3B C(17)-methyltransferase (also named CobJ or CbiH). Precorrin-3B C(17)-methyltransferase participates in the pathway toward the biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B12). There are two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways. The aerobic pathway requires oxygen, and cobalt is inserted late in the pathway; the anaerobic pathway does not require oxygen, and cobalt insertion is the first committed step towards cobalamin synthesis. This model includes CobJ of the aerobic pathway and CbiH of the anaerobic pathway, both as stand-alone enzymes and when CobJ or CbiH form part of bifunctional enzymes, such as in Mycobacterium tuberculosis CobIJ  where CobJ fuses with a precorrin-2 C(20)-methyltransferase domain, or Bacillus megaterium CbiH60, where CbiH is fused to a nitrite and sulfite reductase-like domain. In the aerobic pathway, once CobG has generated precorrin-3b, CobJ catalyzes the methylation of precorrin-3b at C-17 to form precorrin-4 (the extruded methylated C-20 fragment is left attached as an acyl group at C-1). In the corresponding anaerobic  pathway, CbiH carries out this ring contraction, using cobalt-precorrin-3b as a substrate to generate a tetramethylated delta-lactone.</td>

            <td id=al>pfam11760 Cobalamin synthesis G N-terminal. Members of this family are involved in cobalamin synthesis. Synechocystis sp. cbiH represents a fusion between cbiH and cbiG. As other multi-functional proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis catalyze adjacent steps in the pathway, including CysG, CobL (CbiET), CobIJ and CobA-HemD, it is therefore possible that CbiG catalyzes a reaction step adjacent to CbiH. In the anaerobic pathway such a step could be the formation of a gamma lactone, which is thought to help to mediate the anaerobic ring contraction process. Within the cobalamin synthesis pathway CbiG catalyzes the both the opening of the lactone ring and the extrusion of the two-carbon fragment of cobalt-precorrin-5A from C-20 and its associated methyl group (deacylation) to give cobalt-precorrin-5B. The N-terminal of the enzyme is conserved in this family, and the C-terminal and the mid-sections are conserved independently in other families, CbiG_C and CbiG_mid, although the distinct function of each region is unclear.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09815 S-AdoMet-dependent tetrapyrrole methylases. This superfamily uses S-AdoMet (S-adenosyl-L-methionine or SAM) in the methylation of diverse substrates. Most members catalyze various methylation steps in cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis. There are two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in bacteria. The aerobic pathway requires oxygen, and cobalt is inserted late in the pathway; the anaerobic pathway does not require oxygen, and cobalt insertion is the first committed step towards cobalamin synthesis. The enzymes involved in the aerobic pathway are prefixed Cob and those of the anaerobic pathway Cbi. Most of the enzymes are shared by both pathways and a few enzymes are pathway-specific. Diphthine synthase and ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase I (RsmI) are two superfamily members that are not involved in cobalamin biosynthesis. Diphthine synthase participates in the posttranslational modification of a specific histidine residue in elongation factor 2 (EF-2) of eukaryotes and archaea to diphthamide. RsmI catalyzes the 2-O-methylation of the ribose of cytidine 1402 (C1402) in 16S rRNA. Other superfamily members not involved in cobalamin biosynthesis include the N-terminal tetrapyrrole methylase domain of Bacillus subtilis YabN whose specific function is unknown, and Omphalotus olearius omphalotin methyltransferase which catalyzes the automethylation of its own C-terminus; this C terminus is subsequently released and macrocyclized to give Omphalotin A, a potent nematicide.</td>

CbiE (precorrin-6Y methyltransferase, also known as cobalt-precorrin-7 C(5)-methyltransferase, also known as cobalt-precorrin-6Y C(5)-methyltransferase) catalyzes the methylation of C-5 in cobalt-precorrin-7 to form cobalt-precorrin-8. It participates in the pathway toward the biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B12). There are two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in bacteria. The aerobic pathway requires oxygen, and cobalt is inserted late in the pathway; the anaerobic pathway does not require oxygen, and cobalt insertion is the first committed step towards cobalamin synthesis. CbiE functions in the anaerobic pathway, it is a subunit of precorrin-6Y C5,15-methyltransferase, a bifunctional enzyme: cobalt-precorrin-7 C(5)-methyltransferase (CbiE)/cobalt-precorrin-6B C(15)-methyltransferase (decarboxylating) (CbiT), that catalyzes two methylations (at C-5 and C-15) in precorrin-6Y, as well as the decarboxylation of the acetate side chain located in ring C, in order to generate precorrin-8X. CbiE and CbiT can be found fused (CbiET, also called CobL), or on separate protein chains (CbiE and CbiT). In the aerobic pathway, a single enzyme called CobL catalyzes the methylations at C-5 and C-15, and the decarboxylation of the C-12 acetate side chain of precorrin-6B.</td>

            <td id=al>cd11642 Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase (also known as S-Adenosyl-L-methionine:uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase, SUMT). SUMT is an enzyme of the cobalamin and siroheme biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the first of three steps leading to the formation of siroheme from uroporphyrinogen III; it transfers two methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the C-2 and C-7 atoms of uroporphyrinogen III to yield precorrin-2 via the intermediate formation of precorrin-1. Precorrin-2 is also a precursor for the biosynthesis of vitamin B12, coenzyme F430, siroheme and heme d1. This family includes proteins in which the SUMT domain is fused to other functional domains, such as to a uroporphyrinogen-III synthase domain to form bifunctional uroporphyrinogen-III methylase/uroporphyrinogen-III synthase, or to a dual function dehydrogenase-chelatase domain, as in the case of the multifunctional S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent bismethyltransferase/dehydrogenase/ferrochelatase CysG, which catalyzes all three steps that transform uroporphyrinogen III into siroheme.</td>

            <td id=al>cd11645 Precorrin-2 C20-methyltransferase, also named CobI or CbiL.

There are two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in bacteria. The aerobic pathway requires oxygen, and cobalt is inserted late in the pathway; the anaerobic pathway does not require oxygen, and cobalt insertion is the first committed step towards cobalamin synthesis. Precorrin-2 C20-methyltransferase catalyzes methylation at the C-20 position of a cyclic tetrapyrrole ring of precorrin-2 using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl group source to produce precorrin-3A. In the anaerobic pathway, cobalt is inserted into precorrin-2 by CbiK to generate cobalt-precorrin-2, which is the substrate for CbiL, a C20 methyltransferase. In Clostridium difficile, CbiK and CbiL are fused into a bifunctional enzyme. In the aerobic pathway, the precorrin-2 C20-methyltransferase is named CobI. This family includes CbiL and CobI precorrin-2 C20-methyltransferases, both as stand-alone enzymes and when CbiL forms part of a bifunctional enzyme.</td>
