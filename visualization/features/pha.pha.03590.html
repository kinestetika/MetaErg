This is a family of vitamin-B12 independent methionine synthases or 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate--homocysteine methyltransferases, EC:2.1.1.14 from bacteria and plants. Plants are the only higher eukaryotes that have the required enzymes for methionine synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the last step in the production of methionine by transferring a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine. The aligned region makes up the carboxy region of the approximately 750 amino acid protein except in some hypothetical archaeal proteins present in the family, where this region corresponds to the entire length. This domain contains the catalytic residues of the enzyme.</td>

            <td id=al>CIMS - Cobalamine-independent methonine synthase, or MetE, N-terminal domain_like. Many members have been characterized as 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine methyltransferases, EC:2.1.1.14, mostly from bacteria and plants. This enzyme catalyses the last step in the production of methionine by transferring a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to L-homocysteine without using an intermediate methyl carrier. The active enzyme has a dual (beta-alpha)8-barrel structure, and this model covers the N-terminal barrel, and a few single-barrel sequences most similar to the N-terminal barrel. It is assumed that the homologous N-terminal barrel has evolved from the C-terminus via gene duplication and has subsequently lost binding sites, and it seems as if the two barrels forming the active enzyme may sometimes reside on different polypeptides. The C-terminal domain incorporates the Zinc ion, which binds and activates homocysteine. Side chains from both barrels contribute to the binding of the folate substrate.</td>
