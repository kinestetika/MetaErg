            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of bacterial Serine/Threonine kinases, PknB and similar proteins. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily includes many bacterial eukaryotic-type STKs including Staphylococcus aureus PknB (also called PrkC or Stk1), Bacillus subtilis PrkC, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pkn proteins (PknB, PknD, PknE, PknF, PknL, and PknH), among others. S. aureus PknB is the only eukaryotic-type STK present in this species, although many microorganisms encode for several such proteins. It is important for the survival and pathogenesis of S. aureus as it is involved in the regulation of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, autolysis, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. M. tuberculosis PknB is essential for growth and it acts on diverse substrates including proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, cell division, transcription, stress responses, and metabolic regulation. B. subtilis PrkC is located at the inner membrane of endospores and functions to trigger spore germination. Bacterial STKs in this subfamily show varied domain architectures. The well-characterized members such as S. aureus and M. tuberculosis PknB, and B. subtilis PrkC, contain an N-terminal cytosolic  kinase domain, a transmembrane (TM) segment, and mutliple C-terminal extracellular PASTA domains. The PknB subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of Protein Kinases. PKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine or tyrosine residues on protein substrates. PKs make up a large family of serine/threonine kinases (STKs), protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), and dual-specificity PKs that phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues of target proteins. Majority of protein phosphorylation occurs on serine residues while only 1% occurs on tyrosine residues. Protein phosphorylation is a mechanism by which a wide variety of cellular proteins, such as enzymes and membrane channels, are reversibly regulated in response to certain stimuli. PKs often function as components of signal transduction pathways in which one kinase activates a second kinase, which in turn, may act on other kinases; this sequential action transmits a signal from the cell surface to target proteins, which results in cellular responses. The PK family is one of the largest known protein families with more than 100 homologous yeast enzymes and more than 500 human proteins. A fraction of PK family members are pseudokinases that lack crucial residues for catalytic activity. The mutiplicity of kinases allows for specific regulation according to substrate, tissue distribution, and cellular localization. PKs regulate many cellular processes including proliferation, division, differentiation, motility, survival, metabolism, cell-cycle progression, cytoskeletal rearrangement, immunity, and neuronal functions. Many kinases are implicated in the development of various human diseases including different types of cancer. The PK family is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and actin-fragmin kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>The catalytic domain of CAMK family Serine/Threonine Kinases. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. CaMKs are multifunctional calcium and calmodulin (CaM) stimulated STKs involved in cell cycle regulation. There are several types of CaMKs including CaMKI, CaMKII, and CaMKIV. CaMKI proteins are monomeric and they play pivotal roles in the nervous system, including long-term potentiation, dendritic arborization, neurite outgrowth, and the formation of spines, synapses, and axons. CaMKII is a signaling molecule that translates upstream calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals into downstream responses that play important roles in synaptic function and cardiovascular physiology. CAMKIV is implicated in regulating several transcription factors like CREB, MEF2, and retinoid orphan receptors, as well as in T-cell development and signaling. The CAMK family also consists of other related kinases including the Phosphorylase kinase Gamma subunit (PhKG), the C-terminal kinase domains of Ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and Mitogen and stress-activated kinase (MSK), Doublecortin-like kinase (DCKL), and the MAPK-activated protein kinases MK2, MK3, and MK5, among others. The CAMK family is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of AMP-activated protein kinase-like Serine/Threonine Kinases. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. The AMPK-like subfamily is composed of AMPK, MARK, BRSK, NUAK, MELK, SNRK, TSSK, and SIK, among others. LKB1 serves as a master upstream kinase that activates AMPK and most AMPK-like kinases. AMPK, also called SNF1 (sucrose non-fermenting1) in yeasts and SnRK1 (SNF1-related kinase1) in plants, is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic alpha subunit and two regulatory subunits, beta and gamma. It is a stress-activated kinase that serves as master regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism by monitoring carbon and energy supplies, via sensing the cell's AMP:ATP ratio. MARKs phosphorylate tau and related microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and regulates microtubule-based intracellular transport. They are involved in embryogenesis, epithelial cell polarization, cell signaling, and neuronal differentiation. BRSKs play important roles in establishing neuronal polarity. TSSK proteins are almost exclusively expressed postmeiotically in the testis and play important roles in spermatogenesis and/or spermiogenesis. The AMPK-like subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of STE family Protein Kinases. PKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine (ST) or tyrosine residues on protein substrates. This family is composed of STKs, and some dual-specificity PKs that phosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues of target proteins. Most members are kinases involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades, acting as MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs), or MAPKKK kinases (MAP4Ks). The MAPK signaling pathways are important mediators of cellular responses to extracellular signals. The pathways involve a triple kinase core cascade comprising of the MAPK, which is phosphorylated and activated by a MAPKK, which itself is phosphorylated and activated by a MAPKKK. Each MAPK cascade is activated either by a small GTP-binding protein or by an adaptor protein, which transmits the signal either directly to a MAPKKK to start the triple kinase core cascade or indirectly through a mediator kinase, a MAP4K. Other STE family members include p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and class III myosins, among others. PAKs are Rho family GTPase-regulated kinases that serve as important mediators in the function of Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42) and Rac. Class III myosins are motor proteins containing an N-terminal kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal actin-binding domain, which can phosphorylate several cytoskeletal proteins, conventional myosin regulatory light chains, as well as autophosphorylate the C-terminal motor domain. They play an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of photoreceptor cell microvilli. The STE family is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

Also included in this family are Death-Associated Protein Kinases (DAPKs) and Death-associated protein kinase-Related Apoptosis-inducing protein Kinase (DRAKs). MLCK phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain and controls the contraction of all muscle types. Titin, obscurin, Twitchin, and SPEG are muscle proteins involved in the contractile apparatus. The giant STKs are multidomain proteins containing immunoglobulin (Ig), fibronectin type III (FN3), SH3, RhoGEF, PH and kinase domains. Titin, obscurin, Twitchin, and SPEG contain many Ig domain repeats at the N-terminus, while Trio and Kalirin contain spectrin-like repeats.

CaMKs are multifunctional calcium and calmodulin (CaM) stimulated STKs involved in cell cycle regulation. There are several types of CaMKs including CaMKI, CaMKII, and CaMKIV. In vertebrates, there are four CaMKI proteins encoded by different genes (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), each producing at least one variant. CaMKs contain an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain that harbors a CaM binding site. CaMKI proteins are monomeric and they play pivotal roles in the nervous system, including long-term potentiation, dendritic arborization, neurite outgrowth, and the formation of spines, synapses, and axons. In addition, they may be involved in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine kinase, Aurora kinase. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Aurora kinases are key regulators of mitosis and are essential for the accurate and equal division of genomic material from parent to daughter cells. Yeast contains only one Aurora kinase while most higher eukaryotes have two. Vertebrates contain at least 2 Aurora kinases (A and B); mammals contains a third Aurora kinase gene (C). Aurora-A regulates cell cycle events from the late S-phase through the M-phase including centrosome maturation, mitotic entry, centrosome separation, spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, cytokinesis, and mitotic exit. Aurora-A activation depends on its autophosphorylation  and binding to the microtubule-associated protein TPX2. Aurora-B is most active at the transition during metaphase to the end of mitosis. It is critical for accurate chromosomal segregation, cytokinesis, protein localization to the centrosome and kinetochore, correct microtubule-kinetochore attachments, and regulation of the mitotic checkpoint. Aurora-C is mainly expressed in meiotically dividing cells; it was originally discovered in mice as a testis-specific STK called Aie1. Both Aurora-B and -C are chromosomal passenger proteins that can form complexes with INCENP and survivin, and they may have redundant cellular functions. The Aurora subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

MLCK1 (or MYLK1) phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain and controls the contraction of smooth muscles. The MLCK1 gene expresses three transcripts in a cell-specific manner: a short MLCK1 which contains three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like and one fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, PEVK and actin-binding regions, and a kinase domain near the C-terminus followed by a regulatory segment containing an autoinhibitory Ca2+/calmodulin binding site; a long MLCK1 containing six additional Ig-like domains at the N-terminus compared to the short MLCK1; and the C-terminal Ig module which results in the expression of telokin in phasic smooth muscles, leading to Ca2+ desensitization by cyclic nucleotides of smooth muscle force. MLCK1 is also responsible for myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation in nonmuscle cells and may play a role in regulating myosin II ATPase activity.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. IRAKs are involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) signalling pathways, and are thus critical in regulating innate immune responses and inflammation. Some IRAKs may also play roles in T- and B-cell signaling, and adaptive immunity. Vertebrates contain four IRAKs (IRAK-1, -2, -3 (or -M), and -4) that display distinct functions and patterns of expression and subcellular distribution, and can differentially mediate TLR signaling. IRAK-1, -2, and -4 are ubiquitously expressed and are active kinases, while IRAK-M is only induced in monocytes and macrophages and is an inactive kinase. Variations in IRAK genes are linked to diverse diseases including infection, sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. IRAKs contain an N-terminal Death domain (DD), a proST region (rich in serines, prolines, and threonines), a central kinase domain (a pseudokinase domain in the case of IRAK3), and a C-terminal domain; IRAK-4 lacks the C-terminal domain.

Members of this family include cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKA), cGMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKG), Protein Kinase C (PKC), Protein Kinase B (PKB), G protein-coupled Receptor Kinase (GRK), Serum- and Glucocorticoid-induced Kinase (SGK), and 70 kDa ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase (p70S6K or S6K), among others. AGC kinases share an activation mechanism based on the phosphorylation of up to three sites: the activation loop (A-loop), the hydrophobic motif (HM) and the turn motif. Phosphorylation at the A-loop is required of most AGC kinases, which results in a disorder-to-order transition of the A-loop. The ordered conformation results in the access of substrates and ATP to the active site. A subset of AGC kinases with C-terminal extensions containing the HM also requires phosphorylation at this site. Phosphorylation at the HM allows the C-terminal extension to form an ordered structure that packs into the hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic domain, which then reconfigures the kinase into an active bi-lobed state. In addition, growth factor-activated AGC kinases such as PKB, p70S6K, RSK, MSK, PKC, and SGK, require phosphorylation at the turn motif (also called tail or zipper site), located N-terminal to the HM at the C-terminal extension.

It coordinates the utilization of glucose in response to metabolic demand. It contains an N-terminal PAS domain which directly interacts and inhibits a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain. The PAS domain serves as a sensory module for different environmental signals such as light, redox state, and various metabolites. Binding of ligands to the PAS domain causes structural changes which leads to kinase activation and the phosphorylation of substrates to trigger the appropriate cellular response. The PASK subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily is composed of Caenorhabditis elegans and Aplysia californica Twitchin, Drosophila melanogaster Projectin, and similar proteins. These are very large muscle proteins containing multiple immunoglobulin (Ig)-like and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains and a single kinase domain near the C-terminus.

It interacts with the myofibrillar proteins myosin and actin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and may be involved in regulating the myosin cross-bridge cycle. The kinase activity of Twitchen is activated by Ca2+ and the Ca2+ binding protein S100A1. Projectin is associated with the end of thick filaments and is a component of flight muscle connecting filaments. The kinase domain of Projectin may play roles in autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation, which impact the formation of myosin filaments.

It is expressed towards the end of meiosis I and is quickly degraded upon fertilization. It is a component of the cytostatic factor (CSF), which is responsible for metaphase II arrest. In addition, Mos activates a phoshorylation cascade that leads to the activation of the p34 subunit of MPF (mitosis-promoting factor or maturation promoting factor), a cyclin-dependent kinase that is responsible for the release of primary arrest in meiosis I.

SIKs are part of a complex network that regulates Na,K-ATPase to maintain sodium homeostasis and blood pressure. Vertebrates contain three forms of SIKs (SIK1-3) from three distinct genes, which display tissue-specific effects. SIK1, also called SNF1LK, controls steroidogenic enzyme production in adrenocortical cells. In the brain, both SIK1 and SIK2 regulate energy metabolism. SIK2, also called QIK or SNF1LK2, is involved in the regulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver and lipogenesis in adipose tissues, where it phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate-1.

IRAKs contain an N-terminal Death domain (DD), a proST region (rich in serines, prolines, and threonines), a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal domain; IRAK-4 lacks the C-terminal domain. Vertebrates contain four IRAKs (IRAK-1, -2, -3 (or -M), and -4) that display distinct functions and patterns of expression and subcellular distribution, and can differentially mediate TLR signaling.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of inactive phosphorylase b to form the active phosphorylase a. It coordinates hormonal, metabolic, and neuronal signals to initiate the breakdown of glycogen stores, which enables the maintenance of blood-glucose homeostasis during fasting, and is also used as a source of energy for muscle contraction. PhK is one of the largest and most complex protein kinases, composed of a heterotetramer containing four molecules each of four subunit types: one catalytic (gamma) and three regulatory (alpha, beta, and delta). Each subunit has tissue-specific isoforms or splice variants. Vertebrates contain two isoforms of the gamma subunit (gamma 1 and gamma 2). The gamma subunit, when isolated, is constitutively active and does not require phosphorylation of the A-loop for activity. The regulatory subunits restrain this kinase activity until signals are received to relieve this inhibition. For example, the kinase is activated in response to hormonal stimulation, after autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase of the alpha and beta subunits. The high-affinity binding of ADP to the beta subunit also stimulates kinase activity, whereas calcium relieves inhibition by binding to the delta (calmodulin) subunit. The PhKG subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. DAPKs mediate cell death and act as tumor suppressors. They are necessary to induce cell death and their overexpression leads to death-associated changes including membrane blebbing, cell rounding, and formation of autophagic vesicles. Vertebrates contain three subfamily members with different domain architecture, localization, and function. DAPK2, also called DAPK-related protein 1 (DRP-1), is a Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-regulated protein containing an N-terminal kinase domain, a CaM autoinhibitory site and a dimerization module. It lacks the cytoskeletal binding regions of DAPK1 and the exogenous protein has been shown to be soluble and cytoplasmic. FLAG-tagged DAPK2, however, accumulated within membrane-enclosed autophagic vesicles. It is unclear where endogenous DAPK2 is localized. DAPK2 participates in TNF-alpha and FAS-receptor induced cell death and enhances neutrophilic maturation in myeloid leukemic cells. It contributes to the induction of anoikis and its down-regulation is implicated in the beta-catenin induced resistance of malignant epithelial cells to anoikis. The DAPK2 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of inactive phosphorylase b to form the active phosphorylase a. It coordinates hormonal, metabolic, and neuronal signals to initiate the breakdown of glycogen stores, which enables the maintenance of blood-glucose homeostasis during fasting, and is also used as a source of energy for muscle contraction. PhK is one of the largest and most complex protein kinases, composed of a heterotetramer containing four molecules each of four subunit types: one catalytic (gamma) and three regulatory (alpha, beta, and delta). The gamma 1 subunit (PhKG1) is also referred to as the muscle gamma isoform. The gamma subunit, when isolated, is constitutively active and does not require phosphorylation of the A-loop for activity. The regulatory subunits restrain this kinase activity until signals are received to relieve this inhibition. For example, the kinase is activated in response to hormonal stimulation, after autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase of the alpha and beta subunits. The high-affinity binding of ADP to the beta subunit also stimulates kinase activity, whereas calcium relieves inhibition by binding to the delta (calmodulin) subunit.

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine kinase, Inositol-requiring protein 1. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. IRE1, also called Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-nucleus signaling protein (or ERN), is an ER-localized type I transmembrane protein with kinase and endoribonuclease domains in the cytoplasmic side. It acts as an ER stress sensor and is the oldest and most conserved component of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in eukaryotes. The UPR is activated when protein misfolding is detected in the ER in order to decrease the synthesis of new proteins and increase the capacity of the ER to cope with the stress. During ER stress, IRE1 dimerizes and forms oligomers, allowing the kinase domain to undergo trans-autophosphorylation. This leads to a conformational change that stimulates its endoribonuclease activity and results in the cleavage of its mRNA substrate, HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in metazoans, promoting a splicing event that enables translation into a transcription factor which activates the UPR. Mammals contain two IRE1 proteins, IRE1alpha (or ERN1) and IRE1beta (or ERN2). The Ire1 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

The classical pathway regulates the majority of genes activated by NF-kB including those encoding cytokines, chemokines, leukocyte adhesion molecules, and anti-apoptotic factors. It involves NEMO (NF-kB Essential MOdulator)- and IKKbeta-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of the Inhibitor of NF-kB (IkB), which liberates NF-kB dimers (typified by the p50-p65 heterodimer) from an inactive IkB/dimeric NF-kB complex, enabling them to migrate to the nucleus where they regulate gene transcription.

Group I PAKs contain a PBD (p21-binding domain) overlapping with an AID (autoinhibitory domain), a C-terminal catalytic domain, SH3 binding sites and a non-classical SH3 binding site for PIX (PAK-interacting exchange factor). PAK3 is highly expressed in the brain. It is implicated in neuronal plasticity, synapse formation, dendritic spine morphogenesis, cell cycle progression, neuronal migration, and apoptosis. Inactivating mutations in the PAK3 gene cause X-linked non-syndromic mental retardation, the severity of which depends on the site of the mutation.</td>

CDKs belong to a large family of STKs that are regulated by their cognate cyclins. Together, they are involved in the control of cell-cycle progression, transcription, and neuronal function. CDKs are partly regulated by their subcellular localization, which defines substrate phosphorylation and the resulting specific function. CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 have well-defined functions in the cell cycle, such as the regulation of the early G1 phase by CDK4 or CDK6, the G1/S phase transition by CDK2, or the entry of mitosis by CDK1. They also exhibit overlapping cyclin specificity and functions in certain conditions. Knockout mice with a single CDK deleted remain viable with specific phenotypes, showing that some CDKs can compensate for each other. For example, CDK4 can compensate for the loss of CDK6, however, double knockout mice with both CDK4 and CDK6 deleted die in utero.

The pseudokinase domain shows similarity to protein kinases but lacks crucial residues for catalytic activity. EIF2AKs phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eIF-2, resulting in the overall downregulation of protein synthesis. eIF-2 phosphorylation is induced in response to cellular stresses including virus infection, heat shock, nutrient deficiency, and the accummulation of unfolded proteins, among others. There are four distinct kinases that phosphorylate eIF-2 and control protein synthesis under different stress conditions: GCN2, protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR), heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI), and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). GCN2 is activated by amino acid or serum starvation and UV irradiation. It induces GCN4, a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes, leading to increased production of amino acids under amino acid-deficient conditions. In serum-starved cells, GCN2 activation induces translation of the stress-responsive transcription factor ATF4, while under UV stress, GCN2 triggers transcriptional rescue via NF-kappaB signaling. GCN2 contains an N-terminal RWD, a degenerate kinase-like (repeat 1), the catalytic kinase (repeat 2), a histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS)-like, and a C-terminal ribosome-binding and dimerization (RB/DD) domains. The degenerate pseudokinase domain of GCN2 may function as a regulatory domain.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Mammals have two cGK isoforms from different genes, cGKI and cGKII. cGKI exists as two splice variants, cGKI-alpha and cGKI-beta. cGK consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain containing a dimerization and an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate region, two cGMP-binding domains, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Binding of cGMP to both binding sites releases the inhibition of the catalytic center by the pseudosubstrate region, allowing autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase. cGKI is a  soluble protein expressed in all smooth muscles, platelets, cerebellum, and kidney. It is also expressed at lower concentrations in other tissues. cGKII is a membrane-bound protein that is most abundantly expressed in the intestine. It is also present in the brain nuclei, adrenal cortex, kidney, lung, and prostate. cGKI is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, smooth cell proliferation, and platelet activation. cGKII plays a role in the regulation of secretion, such as renin secretion by the kidney and aldosterone secretion by the adrenal.

Vertebrates contain two members, LRRK1 and LRRK2, which show complementary expression in the brain. Mutations in LRRK2 are linked to both familial and sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease. The normal roles of LRRKs are not clearly defined.

PTKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to tyrosine (tyr) residues in protein substrates. EGFR (HER, ErbB) subfamily members include EGFR (HER1, ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3), HER4 (ErbB4), and similar proteins. They are receptor PTKs (RTKs) containing an extracellular EGF-related ligand-binding region, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic region with a tyr kinase domain and a regulatory C-terminal tail. Unlike other PTKs, phosphorylation of the activation loop of EGFR proteins is not critical to their activation. Instead, they are activated by ligand-induced dimerization, resulting in the phosphorylation of tyr residues in the C-terminal tail, which serve as binding sites for downstream signaling molecules. Collectively, they can recognize a variety of ligands including EGF, TGFalpha, and neuregulins, among others. All four subfamily members can form homo- or heterodimers. HER3 contains an impaired kinase domain and depends on its heterodimerization partner for activation. EGFR subfamily members are involved in signaling pathways leading to a broad range of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. Gain of function alterations, through their overexpression, deletions, or point mutations in their kinase domains, have been implicated in various cancers. These receptors are targets of many small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies used in cancer therapy. The EGFR subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other kinases such as protein serine/threonine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

Overexpression of HIPK3 does not affect cell death, however its expression in prostate cancer cells contributes to increased resistance to Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. HIPK3 also plays a role in regulating steroidogenic gene expression. In response to cAMP, HIPK3 activates the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun, leading to increased activity of the transcription factor SF-1 (Steroidogenic factor 1), a key regulator for steroid biosynthesis in the gonad and adrenal gland.

Receptor tyr kinases (RTKs) are integral membrane proteins which contain an extracellular ligand-binding region, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular tyr kinase domain. RTKs are usually activated through ligand binding, which causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyr kinase catalytic domain, leading to intracellular signaling. Some RTKs are orphan receptors with no known ligands. Non-receptor (or cytoplasmic) tyr kinases are distributed in different intracellular compartments and are usually multi-domain proteins containing a catalytic tyr kinase domain as well as various regulatory domains such as SH3 and SH2. PTKs are usually autoinhibited and require a mechanism for activation. In many PTKs, the phosphorylation of tyr residues in the activation loop is essential for optimal activity.

There are three MAPK subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. In mammalian cells, there are seven MAPKKs (named MKK1-7) and 20 MAPKKKs. Each MAPK subfamily can be activated by at least two cognate MAPKKs and by multiple MAPKKKs. The MAPKK subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

PTKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to tyrosine (tyr) residues in protein substrates. Tyk2 is widely expressed in many tissues. It is involved in signaling via the cytokine receptors IFN-alphabeta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-23. It mediates cell surface urokinase receptor (uPAR) signaling and plays a role in modulating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) functional behavior in response to injury. Tyk2 is also important in dendritic cell function and T helper (Th)1 cell differentiation. A homozygous mutation of Tyk2 was found in a patient with hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), a primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent skin abscesses, pneumonia, and elevated serum IgE. This suggests that Tyk2 may play important roles in multiple cytokine signaling involved in innate and adaptive immunity. Tyk2 is a member of the Janus kinase (Jak) subfamily of proteins, which are cytoplasmic (or nonreceptor) PTKs containing an N-terminal FERM domain, followed by a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, a pseudokinase domain, and a C-terminal tyr kinase catalytic domain. Jaks are crucial for cytokine receptor signaling. They are activated by autophosphorylation upon cytokine-induced receptor aggregation, and subsequently trigger downstream signaling events such as the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs).

It regulates gene transcription during development and in DNA damage response (DDR), and mediates cell processes such as apoptosis, survival, differentiation, and proliferation. HIPK2 mediates apoptosis by phosphorylating and activating p53 during DDR, resulting in the activation of apoptotic genes. In the absence of p53, HIPK2 targets the anti-apoptotic corepressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), leading to CtBP's degradation and the promotion of apoptosis.
