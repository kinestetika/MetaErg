Compared with the D1-small domain (included in AAA) it lacks the long coiled-coil insertion, and instead of helix C4 contains a beta-strand (e3) that is part of a three stranded beta-pleated sheet. In Thermophilus the whole protein forms a hexamer with the D1-small and D2-small domains located on the outside of the hexamer, with the long coiled-coil being exposed on the surface. The D2-small domain is essential for oligomerisation, forming a tight interface with the D2-large domain of a neighbouring subunit and thereby providing enough binding energy to stabilise the functional assembly. The domain is associated with two Clp_N at the N-terminus as well as AAA and AAA_2.</td>

            <td id=al>first of two ATPase domains of CDC48 and NLV2, and similar ATPase domains. CDC48 in yeast and p97 or VCP metazoans is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone which plays an essential role in many cellular processes, by segregating polyubiquitinated proteins from complexes or membranes. Cdc48/p97 consists of an N-terminal domain and two ATPase domains; this subfamily represents the first of the two ATPase domains. This subfamily also includes the first of the two ATPase domains of NVL (nuclear VCP-like protein) 2, an isoform of NVL mainly present in the nucleolus, which is involved in ribosome biogenesis, in telomerase assembly and the regulation of telomerase activity, and in pre-rRNA processing. This subfamily belongs to the RecA-like NTPase family which includes the NTP binding domain of F1 and V1 H(+)ATPases, DnaB and related helicases as well as bacterial RecA and related eukaryotic and archaeal recombinases. The RecA-like NTPase family also includes bacterial conjugation proteins and related DNA transfer proteins involved in type II and type IV secretion.</td>

            <td id=al>first of two ATPase domains of NVL (nuclear VCP-like protein) and similar ATPase domains. NVL exists in two forms with N-terminal extensions of different lengths in mammalian cells. NVL has two alternatively spliced isoforms, a short form, NVL1, and a long form, NVL2. NVL2, the major species, is mainly present in the nucleolus, whereas NVL1 is nucleoplasmic. Each has an N-terminal domain, followed by two tandem ATPase domains; this subfamily includes the first of the two ATPase domains. NVL2 is involved in the biogenesis of the 60S ribosome subunit by associating specifically with ribosome protein L5 and modulating the function of DOB1. NVL2 is also required for telomerase assembly and the regulation of telomerase activity, and is involved in pre-rRNA processing. The role of NVL1 is unclear. This RecA-like_NVL_r1-like subfamily belongs to the RecA-like NTPase family which includes the NTP binding domain of F1 and V1 H(+)ATPases, DnaB and related helicases as well as bacterial RecA and related eukaryotic and archaeal recombinases. The RecA-like NTPase family also includes bacterial conjugation proteins and related DNA transfer proteins involved in type II and type IV secretion.</td>
