            <td id=al>N-terminal domain of bacterial GlmU. The N-terminal domain of N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU). GlmU is an essential bacterial enzyme with both an acetyltransferase and an uridyltransferase activity which have been mapped to the C-terminal and N-terminal domains, respectively. This family represents the N-terminal uridyltransferase. GlmU performs the last two steps in the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is an essential precursor in both the peptidoglycan and the lipopolysaccharide metabolic pathways in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively.</td>

It is a bifunctional bacterial enzyme that catalyzes two consecutive steps in the formation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an important precursor in bacterial cell wall formation. The two enzymatic activities, uridyltransferase and acetyltransferase, are carried out by two independent domains. The C-terminal LbH domain possesses the acetyltransferase activity. It catalyzes the CoA-dependent acetylation of GlcN-1-phosphate to GlcNAc-1-phosphate. The LbH domain contains 10 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X. The acetyltransferase active site is located at the interface between two subunits of the active LbH trimer.</td>

Members in this family are predicted to be glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferases, which are involved in the dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway. Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase catalyzes the synthesis of deoxy-thymidine di-phosphate (dTDP)-L-rhamnose, an important component of the cell wall of many microorganisms. The C-terminal LbH domain contains multiple turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X). Proteins containing hexapeptide repeats are often enzymes showing acyltransferase activity.</td>

It contains an N-terminal LbH domain responsible for the transacetylation function and a C-terminal isomerase domain.

            <td id=al>Phosphocholine cytidylyltransferases catalyze the synthesis of CDP-choline. This family contains proteins similar to prokaryotic phosphocholine (P-cho) cytidylyltransferases. Phosphocholine (PC) cytidylyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a cytidine monophosphate from CTP to phosphocholine to form CDP-choline. PC is the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic membranes and it is also important in prokaryotic membranes. For pathogenic prokaryotes, the cell surface PC facilitates the interaction with host surface and induces attachment and invasion. In addition cell wall PC serves as scaffold for a group of choline-binding proteins that are secreted from the cells. Phosphocholine (PC) cytidylyltransferase is a key enzyme in the prokaryotic choline metabolism pathway. It has been hypothesized to consist of a choline transport system, a choline kinase, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, and a choline phosphotransferase that transfers P-Cho from CDP-Cho to either lipoteichoic acid or lipopolysaccharide.</td>

            <td id=al>G1P_TT_long represents the long form of glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase. This family is the long form of Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase.  Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase catalyses the formation of dTDP-glucose, from dTTP and glucose 1-phosphate. It is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-rhamnose, a cell wall constituent and a feedback inhibitor of the enzyme.There are two forms of   Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase in bacteria and archeae; short form and long form.  The long form, which has an extra 50 amino acids c-terminal, is found in many species for which it serves as a sugar-activating enzyme for antibiotic biosynthesis and or other, unknown pathways, and in which dTDP-L-rhamnose is not necessarily produced.The long from enzymes also have a left-handed parallel helix domain at the c-terminus, whereas, th eshort form enzymes do not have this domain. The homotetrameric, feedback inhibited short form is found in numerous bacterial species that produce dTDP-L-rhamnose.</td>

            <td id=al>NTP_trnasferase_like_2 is a member of the nucleotidyl transferase family. This is a subfamily of nucleotidyl transferases. Nucleotidyl transferases transfer nucleotides onto phosphosugars. The activated sugars are precursors for synthesis of lipopolysaccharide, glycolipids and polysaccharides. Other subfamilies of nucleotidyl transferases include Alpha-D-Glucose-1-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase, Mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase, and Glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase.</td>

            <td id=al>sugar O-acyltransferase, sialic acid O-acetyltransferase NeuD family. This family of proteins includes the characterized NeuD sialic acid O-acetyltransferase enzymes from E. coli and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B strep). These two are quite closely related to one another, so extension of this annotation to other members of the family in unsupported without additional independent evidence. The neuD gene is often observed in close proximity to the neuABC genes for the biosynthesis of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-sialic acid), and NeuD sequences from these organisms were used to construct the seed for this model. Nevertheless, there are numerous instances of sequences identified by this model which are observed in a different genomic context (although almost universally in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis-related loci), as well as in genomes for which the biosynthesis of sialic acid (SA) is undemonstrated. Even in the cases where the association with SA biosynthesis is strong, it is unclear in the literature whether the biological substrate is SA iteself, CMP-SA, or a polymer containing SA. Similarly, it is unclear to what extent the enzyme has a preference for acetylation at the 7, 8 or 9 positions. In the absence of evidence of association with SA, members of this family may be involved with the acetylation of differring sugar substrates, or possibly the delivery of alternative acyl groups. The closest related sequences to this family (and those used to root the phylogenetic tree constructed to create this model) are believed to be succinyltransferases involved in lysine biosynthesis. These proteins contain repeats of the bacterial transferase hexapeptide (pfam00132), although often these do not register above the trusted cutoff.</td>

Members of this protein include MocA, which transfers cytosine from CTP to molybdopterin during molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide (MCD) cofactor biosynthesis. It is distantly related to MobA, the GTP:molybdopterin guanylyltransferase. The MocA family is particularly closely related in phylogenetic distribution to other markers of selenium-dependent molybdenum hydroxylases (SDMH), suggesting most SDMH must use MCD rather than molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide.</td>

            <td id=al>Serine acetyltransferase (SAT): SAT catalyzes the CoA-dependent acetylation of the side chain hydroxyl group of L-serine to form O-acetylserine, as the first step of a two-step biosynthetic pathway in bacteria and plants leading to the formation of L-cysteine. This reaction represents a key metabolic point of regulation for the cysteine biosynthetic pathway due to its feedback inhibition by cysteine. The enzyme is a 175 kDa homohexamer, composed of a dimer of homotrimers. Each subunit contains an N-terminal alpha helical region and a C-terminal left-handed beta-helix (LbH) subdomain with 5 turns, each containing a hexapeptide repeat motif characteristic of the acyltransferase superfamily of enzymes. The trimer interface mainly involves the C-terminal LbH subdomain while the dimer (of trimers) interface is mediated by the N-terminal alpha helical subdomain.</td>

This constitutes the third step in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway in Gram-negative bacteria. LpxD is a homotrimer, with each subunit consisting of a novel combination of an N-terminal uridine-binding domain, a core lipid-binding left-handed parallel beta helix (LbH) domain, and a C-terminal alpha-helical extension. The LbH domain contains 9 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X).</td>
