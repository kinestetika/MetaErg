            <td id=al>cd07438 Polymerase and Histidinol Phosphatase domain of Histidinol phosphate phosphatase (HisPPase) AMP bound. The PHP domain of this HisPPase family has an unknown function. It has a second domain inserted in the middle that binds adenosine 5-monophosphate (AMP). The PHP (also called histidinol phosphatase-2/HIS2) domain is associated with several types of DNA polymerases, such as PolIIIA and family X DNA polymerases, stand alone histidinol phosphate phosphatases (HisPPases), and a number of uncharacterized protein families. HisPPase catalyzes the eighth step of histidine biosynthesis, in which L-histidinol phosphate undergoes dephosphorylation to give histidinol. The PHP domain has four conserved sequence motifs and contains an invariant histidine that is involved in metal ion coordination. The PHP domain of HisPPase is structurally homologous to the other members of the PHP family that have a distorted (beta/alpha)7 barrel fold with a trinuclear metal site on the C-terminal side of the barrel.</td>

HisPPase catalyzes the eighth step of histidine biosynthesis, in which L-histidinol phosphate undergoes dephosphorylation to produce histidinol. HisPPase can be classified into two types: the bifunctional HisPPase found in proteobacteria that belongs to the DDDD superfamily and the monofunctional Bacillus subtilis type that is a member of the PHP family. The PHP (also called histidinol phosphatase-2/HIS2) domain is associated with several types of DNA polymerases, such as PolIIIA and family X DNA polymerases, stand alone histidinol phosphate phosphatases (HisPPases), and a number of uncharacterized protein families.

This domain, a branch of the PHP superfamily, is found in several partially characterized metallohydrolases, including McbA and CehA. Both were studied as hydrolases of carbaryl, a xenobiotic compound that does not contain a phosphate group, suggesting that presuming members of this family to be phosphoesterases (like many PHP domain-containing proteins) may be incorrect.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07431 Polymerase and Histidinol Phosphatase domain of alpha-subunit of bacterial polymerase III. PolIIIAs that contain an N-terminal PHP domain have been classified into four basic groups based on genome composition, phylogenetic, and domain structural analysis: polC, dnaE1, dnaE2, and dnaE3. The PHP (also called histidinol phosphatase-2/HIS2) domain is associated with several types of DNA polymerases, such as PolIIIA and family X DNA polymerases, stand alone histidinol phosphate phosphatases (HisPPases), and a number of uncharacterized protein families. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is one of the five eubacterial DNA polymerases that is responsible for the replication of the DNA duplex. The alpha subunit of DNA polymerase III core enzyme catalyzes the reaction for polymerizing both DNA strands. The PolIIIA PHP domain has four conserved sequence motifs and contains an invariant histidine that is involved in metal ion coordination, and like other PHP structures, exhibits a distorted (beta/alpha) 7 barrel and coordinates up to 3 metals. Initially, it was proposed that PHP region might be involved in pyrophosphate hydrolysis, but such activity has not been found. It has been shown that the PHP domain of PolIIIA has a trinuclear metal complex and is capable of proofreading activity.</td>

It has been shown that the PHP of PolIIIA has a trinuclear metal complex and is capable of proofreading activity. Bacterial genome replication and DNA repair mechanisms is related to the GC content of its genomes. There is a correlation between GC content variations and the dimeric combinations of PolIIIA subunits. Eubacteria can be grouped into different GC variable groups: the full-spectrum or dnaE1 group, the high-GC or dnaE2-dnaE1 group, and the low GC or polC-dnaE3 group.</td>
