            <td id=al>Histidine phosphatase domain found in phosphoglycerate mutases and related proteins, mostly phosphatases; contains a His residue which is phosphorylated during the reaction. Subgroup of the catalytic domain of a functionally diverse set of proteins, most of which are phosphatases. The conserved catalytic core of this domain contains a His residue which is phosphorylated in the reaction. This subgroup contains cofactor-dependent and cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutases (dPGM, and BPGM respectively), fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F26BP)ase, Sts-1, SixA, and related proteins. Functions include roles in metabolism, signaling, or regulation, for example, F26BPase affects glycolysis and gluconeogenesis through controlling the concentration of F26BP; BPGM controls the concentration of 2,3-BPG (the main allosteric effector of hemoglobin in human blood cells); human Sts-1 is a T-cell regulator; Escherichia coli Six A participates in the ArcB-dependent His-to-Asp phosphorelay signaling system. Deficiency and mutation in many of the human members result in disease, for example erythrocyte BPGM deficiency is a disease associated with a decrease in the concentration of 2,3-BPG.</td>

This set of proteins includes cofactor-dependent and cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutases (dPGM, and BPGM respectively), fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F26BP)ase, Sts-1, SixA, histidine acid phosphatases, phytases, and related proteins. Functions include roles in metabolism, signaling, or regulation, for example F26BPase affects glycolysis and gluconeogenesis through controlling the concentration of F26BP; BPGM controls the concentration of 2,3-BPG (the main allosteric effector of hemoglobin in human blood cells); human Sts-1 is a T-cell regulator; Escherichia coli Six A participates in the ArcB-dependent His-to-Asp phosphorelay signaling system; phytases scavenge phosphate from extracellular sources. Deficiency and mutation in many of the human members result in disease, for example erythrocyte BPGM deficiency is a disease associated with a decrease in the concentration of 2,3-BPG. Clinical applications include the use of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) as a serum marker for prostate cancer. Agricultural applications include the addition of phytases to animal feed.</td>

            <td id=al>Phosphoglycerate mutase family. Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) and bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) are structurally related enzymes that catalyse reactions involving the transfer of phospho groups between the three carbon atoms of phosphoglycerate... Both enzymes can catalyse three different reactions with different specificities, the isomerization of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) as the primer of the reaction, the synthesis of 2,3-DPG from 1,3-DPG with 3-PGA as a primer and the degradation of 2,3-DPG to 3-PGA (phosphatase activity). In mammals, PGAM is a dimeric protein with two isoforms, the M (muscle) and B (brain) forms. In yeast, PGAM is a tetrameric protein.</td>

            <td id=al>Histidine phosphatase superfamily (branch 1). The histidine phosphatase superfamily is so named because catalysis centers on a conserved His residue that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle. Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue. Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue. The superfamily may be divided into two main branches. The larger branch 1 contains a wide variety of catalytic functions, the best known being fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (found in a bifunctional protein with 2-phosphofructokinase) and cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase. The latter is an unusual example of a mutase activity in the superfamily: the vast majority of members appear to be phosphatases. The bacterial regulatory protein phosphatase SixA is also in branch 1 and has a minimal, and possible ancestral-like structure, lacking the large domain insertions that contribute to binding of small molecules in branch 1 members.</td>
