            <td id=al>Nucleoside diphosphate kinase Group I (NDPk_I)-like: NDP kinase domains are present in a large family of structurally and functionally conserved proteins from bacteria to humans that generally catalyze the transfer of gamma-phosphates of a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) donor onto a nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) acceptor through a phosphohistidine intermediate. The mammalian nm23/NDP kinase gene family can be divided into two distinct groups. The group I genes encode proteins that generally have highly homologous counterparts in other organisms and possess the classic enzymatic activity of a kinase. This group includes vertebrate NDP kinases A-D (Nm23- H1 to -H4),  and its counterparts in bacteria, archea and other eukaryotes. NDP kinases exist in two different quaternary structures; all known eukaryotic enzymes are hexamers, while some bacterial enzymes are tetramers, as in Myxococcus. They possess the NDP kinase active site motif (NXXH[G/A]SD) and the nine residues that are most essential for catalysis.</td>

            <td id=al>Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDP kinases, NDPks): NDP kinases, responsible for the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), are involved in numerous regulatory processes associated with proliferation, development, and differentiation. They are vital for DNA/RNA synthesis, cell division, macromolecular metabolism and growth. The enzymes generate NTPs or their deoxy derivatives by terminal (gamma) phosphotransfer from an NTP such as ATP or GTP to any nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) or its deoxy derivative. The sequence of NDPk has been highly conserved through evolution. There is a single histidine residue conserved in all known NDK isozymes, which is involved in the catalytic mechanism. The first confirmed metastasis suppressor gene was the NDP kinase protein encoded by the nm23 gene. Unicellular organisms generally possess only one gene encoding NDP kinase, while most multicellular organisms possess not only an ortholog that provides most of the NDP kinase enzymatic activity but also multiple divergent paralogous genes. The human genome codes for at least nine NDP kinases and can be classified into two groups, Groups I and II, according to their genomic architecture and distinct enzymatic activity. Group I isoforms (A-D) are well-conserved, catalytically active, and share 58-88% identity between each other, while Group II are more divergent, with only NDPk6 shown to be active. NDP kinases exist in two different quaternary structures; all known eukaryotic enzymes are hexamers, while some bacterial enzymes are tetramers, as in Myxococcus. The hexamer can be viewed as trimer of dimers, while tetramers are dimers of dimers, with the dimerization interface conserved.</td>

The function of the DM10 domain, which also occurs in multiple copies in other proteins, is unknown. NDPk7 is predominantly expressed in testes, although appreciable amount are also found in liver, heart, brain, ovary, small intestine and spleen. The nm23-H7 gene is located in or near the hereditary prostrate cancer susceptibility locus. Nm23-H7 may be involved in the development of colon and gastric carcinoma, the latter possibly in a type-specific manner.</td>

NDPk6 has all nine residues considered crucial for enzyme structure and activity, and has been found to have NDP kinase activity. It may play a role in cell growth and cell cycle progression.

It belongs to the nm23 Group II genes and appears to differ from the other human NDPks in that it lacks two important catalytic site residues, and thus does not appear to possess NDP kinase activity. NDPk5 confers protection from cell death by Bax and alters the cellular levels of several antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase 5 (Gpx5).</td>

Sptrx-2, which has a tissue specific distribution in human testis, has been considered as a member of the nm23 family (nm23-H8) and exhibits a high homology with sea urchin IC1 (intermediate chain-1) protein, a component of the sperm axonemal outer dynein arm complex. Txl-2 is mainly represented in close association with microtubules within tissues with cilia and flagella such as seminiferous epithelium (spermatids) and lung airway epithelium, suggesting possible role in control of microtubule stability and maintenance.</td>
