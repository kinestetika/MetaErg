The UMP kinase of E. coli (Ec) is known to function as a homohexamer, with GTP and UTP being allosteric effectors. Like other related enzymes (carbamate kinase, aspartokinase, and N-acetylglutamate kinase) the E. coli and most bacterial and chloroplast UMPKs (this CD) have a conserved, N-terminal, lysine residue proposed to function in the catalysis of the phosphoryl group transfer, whereas most archaeal UMPKs appear to lack this residue and the Pyrococcus furiosus structure has an additional Mg ion bound to the ATP molecule which is proposed to function as the catalysis instead. Members of this CD belong to the Amino Acid Kinase Superfamily (AAK).</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR02075 uridylate kinase. This protein, also called UMP kinase, converts UMP to UDP by adding a phosphate from ATP. It is the first step in pyrimidine biosynthesis. GTP is an allosteric activator. In a large fraction of all bacterial genomes, the gene tends to be located immediately downstream of elongation factor Ts and upstream of ribosome recycling factor. A related protein family, believed to be equivalent in function and found in the archaea and in spirochetes, is described by a separate model, TIGR02076.

Regulation of this process is via feed-back control and via gene repression of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (the first enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway).

Also included in this CD are the alpha and beta subunits of the Mo storage protein (MosA and MosB) characterized as an alpha4-beta4 octamer containing an ATP-dependent, polynuclear molybdenum-oxide cluster. These and related  sequences in this CD are members of the Amino Acid Kinase Superfamily (AAK).</td>

This family consists of the archaeal and spirochete proteins most closely related to bacterial uridylate kinases (TIGR02075), an enzyme involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Members are likely, but not known, to be functionally equivalent to their bacterial counterparts. However, substantial sequence differences suggest that regulatory mechanisms may be different; the bacterial form is allosterically regulated by GTP.

The AAK superfamily includes kinases that phosphorylate a variety of amino acid substrates. These kinases catalyze the formation of phosphoric anhydrides, generally with a carboxylate, and use ATP as the source of the phosphoryl group; are involved in amino acid biosynthesis. Some of these kinases control the process via allosteric feed-back inhibition.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04242 AAK_G5K_ProB: Glutamate-5-kinase (G5K) catalyzes glutamate-dependent ATP cleavage; G5K transfers the terminal phosphoryl group of ATP to the gamma-carboxyl group of glutamate, in the first and controlling step of proline (and, in mammals, ornithine) biosynthesis. G5K is subject to feedback allosteric inhibition by proline or ornithine. In microorganisms and plants, proline plays an important role as an osmoprotectant and, in mammals, ornithine biosynthesis is crucial for proper ammonia detoxification, since a G5K mutation has been shown to cause human hyperammonaemia. Microbial G5K generally consists of two domains: a catalytic G5K domain and one PUA (pseudo uridine synthases and archaeosine-specific transglycosylases) domain, and some lack the PUA domain. G5K requires free Mg for activity, it is tetrameric, and it aggregates to higher forms in a proline-dependent way. G5K lacking the PUA domain remains tetrameric, active, and proline-inhibitable, but the Mg requirement and the proline-triggered aggregation are greatly diminished and abolished, respectively, and more proline is needed for inhibition. Although plant and animal G5Ks are part of a bifunctional polypeptide, delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), composed of an N-terminal G5K (ProB) and a C-terminal glutamyl 5- phosphate reductase (G5PR; ProA); bacterial and yeast G5Ks are monofunctional single-polypeptide enzymes. In this CD, all three domain architectures are present: G5K, G5K+PUA, and G5K+G5PR.</td>
