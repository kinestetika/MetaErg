            <td id=al>Tetratricopeptide repeat. The Tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) typically contains 34 amino acids and is found in a variety of organisms including bacteria, cyanobacteria, yeast, fungi, plants, and humans. It is present in a variety of proteins including those involved in chaperone, cell-cycle, transcription, and protein transport complexes. The number of TPR motifs varies among proteins. Those containing 5-6 tandem repeats generate a right-handed helical structure with an amphipathic channel that is thought to accommodate an alpha-helix of a target protein. It has been proposed that TPR proteins preferentially interact with WD-40 repeat proteins, but in many instances several TPR-proteins seem to aggregate to multi-protein complexes.</td>

            <td id=al>putative PEP-CTERM system TPR-repeat lipoprotein. This protein family occurs in strictly within a subset of Gram-negative bacterial species with the proposed PEP-CTERM/exosortase system, analogous to the LPXTG/sortase system common in Gram-positive bacteria. This protein occurs in a species if and only if a transmembrane histidine kinase (TIGR02916) and a DNA-binding response regulator (TIGR02915) also occur. The present of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) suggests protein-protein interaction, possibly for the regulation of PEP-CTERM protein expression, since many PEP-CTERM proteins in these genomes are preceded by a proposed DNA binding site for the response regulator.</td>
