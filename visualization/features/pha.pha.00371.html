            <td id=al>histone-like DNA-binding protein HU. This subfamily includes HU and HU-like domains. HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.</td>

            <td id=al>Beta subunit of integration host factor (IHFB). This subfamily consists of the beta subunit of integration host factor (IHF) and IHF-like domains. IHF is a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that binds and sharply bends many DNA targets in a sequence specific manner. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two highly homologous subunits IHFA (IHF-alpha) and IHFB (IHF-beta). It is known to act as a transcription factor at many gene regulatory regions in E. coli. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). IHF is also involved in formation as well as maintenance of bacterial biofilms since it is found in complex with extracellular DNA (eDNA) within the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of many biofilms.</td>

            <td id=al>DNA sequence specific (IHF) and non-specific (HU) domains. This family includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation. IHF binds DNA in a sequence specific manner while HU displays little or no sequence preference. IHF homologs are usually heterodimers, while HU homologs are typically homodimers (except HU heterodimers from E. coli and other enterobacteria). HU is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. IHF is an essential cofactor in phage lambda site-specific recombination, having an architectural role during assembly of specialized nucleoprotein structures (snups). Bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1) is another related type II DNA-binding protein. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.</td>

Hbb, a homodimer, shows DNA sequence preferences that are related, yet distinct from those of IHF.</td>

This group contains proteins related to bacillus phage SPO1-encoded transcription factor 1 (TF1),  a type II DNA-binding protein related to the DNA sequence specific (IHF) and non-specific (HU) domains. Type II DNA-binding proteins bind and bend DNA as dimers. Like IHF, TF1 binds DNA specifically and bends DNA sharply.  Bacteriophage SPO1-encoded TF1 recognizes SPO1 phage DNA containing 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine as opposed to thymine,   Related  family members includes integration host factor (IHF) and HU, also called type II DNA-binding proteins (DNABII), which are small dimeric proteins that specifically bind the DNA minor groove, inducing large bends in the DNA and serving as architectural factors in a variety of cellular processes such as recombination, initiation of replication/transcription and gene regulation.
