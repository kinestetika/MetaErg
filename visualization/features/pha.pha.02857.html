            <td id=al>cd00761 Glycosyltransferase family A (GT-A) includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are enzymes that synthesize oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates by transferring the sugar moiety from an activated nucleotide-sugar donor to an acceptor molecule, which may be a growing oligosaccharide, a lipid, or a protein.  Based on the stereochemistry of the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins. But it also includes families GT-43, GT-6, GT-8, GT13 and GT-7; which are evolutionarily related to GT-2 and share structure similarities.</td>

Succinoglycan is an acidic exopolysaccharide that is important for invasion of the nodules. Succinoglycan is a high-molecular-weight polymer composed of repeating octasaccharide units. These units are synthesized on membrane-bound isoprenoid lipid carriers, beginning with galactose followed by seven glucose molecules, and modified by the addition of acetate, succinate, and pyruvate.

In bacteria, algae and lower eukaryotes, there is a second unrelated type of cellulose synthase (Type II), which produces acylated cellulose, a derivative of cellulose. Chitin synthase catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from substrate UDP-GlcNAc into chitin, which is a linear homopolymer of beta-(1,4)-linked GlcNAc residues and Glucan Biosynthesis protein catalyzes the elongation of beta-1,2 polyglucose chains of Glucan.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06439 CESA_like_1 is a member of the cellulose synthase (CESA) superfamily. This is a subfamily of cellulose synthase (CESA) superfamily.  CESA superfamily includes a wide variety of glycosyltransferase family 2 enzymes that share the common characteristic of catalyzing the elongation of polysaccharide chains.  The members of the superfamily include cellulose synthase catalytic subunit, chitin synthase, glucan biosynthesis protein and other families of CESA-like proteins.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06420 N-terminal domain of Chondroitin polymerase functions as a GalNAc transferase. Chondroitin polymerase is a two domain, bi-functional protein. The N-terminal domain functions as a GalNAc transferase. The bacterial chondroitin polymerase catalyzes elongation of the chondroitin chain by alternatively transferring the GlcUA and GalNAc moiety from UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc to the non-reducing ends of the chondroitin chain. The enzyme consists of N-terminal and C-terminal domains in which the two active sites catalyze the addition of GalNAc and GlcUA, respectively. Chondroitin chains range from 40 to over 100 repeating units of the disaccharide. Sulfated chondroitins are involved in the regulation of various biological functions such as central nervous system development, wound repair, infection, growth factor signaling, and morphogenesis, in addition to its conventional structural roles. In Caenorhabditis elegans, chondroitin is an essential factor for the worm to undergo cytokinesis and cell division. Chondroitin is synthesized as proteoglycans, sulfated and secreted to the cell surface or extracellular matrix.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04179 DPM_DPG-synthase_like is a member of the Glycosyltransferase 2 superfamily. DPM1 is the catalytic subunit of eukaryotic dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM) synthase. DPM synthase is required for synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, N-glycan precursor, protein O-mannose, and C-mannose. In higher eukaryotes,the enzyme has three subunits, DPM1, DPM2 and DPM3. DPM is synthesized from dolichol phosphate and GDP-Man on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane by DPM synthase and then is flipped onto the luminal side and used as a donor substrate. In lower eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trypanosoma brucei, DPM synthase consists of a single component (Dpm1p and TbDpm1, respectively) that possesses one predicted transmembrane region near the C terminus for anchoring to the ER membrane. In contrast, the Dpm1 homologues of higher eukaryotes, namely fission yeast, fungi, and animals, have no transmembrane region, suggesting the existence of adapter molecules for membrane anchoring. This family also includes bacteria and archaea DPM1_like enzymes. However, the enzyme structure and mechanism of function are not well understood. The UDP-glucose:dolichyl-phosphate glucosyltransferase (DPG_synthase) is a transmembrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum involved in protein N-linked glycosylation. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to dolichyl phosphate. This protein family belongs to Glycosyltransferase 2 superfamily.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02526 RfbF is a putative dTDP-rhamnosyl transferase. Shigella flexneri RfbF protein is a putative dTDP-rhamnosyl transferase. dTDP rhamnosyl  transferases of Shigella flexneri  add rhamnose sugars to N-acetyl-glucosamine in the O-antigen tetrasaccharide repeat. Lipopolysaccharide O antigens are important virulence determinants for many bacteria. The variations of sugar composition, the sequence of the sugars and the linkages in the O antigen provide structural diversity of the O antigen.</td>
