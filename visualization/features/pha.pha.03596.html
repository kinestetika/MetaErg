The cupins are a functionally diverse superfamily originally discovered based on the highly conserved motif found in germin and germin-like proteins.

XcTcmJ is annotated as being involved in tetracenomycin polyketide biosynthesis. Also included is Xc5357 from a different strain of X. campestris. Structure studies show that binding of zinc induces conformational changes and serves a functional role in this cupin protein.

            <td id=al>Phosphomannose isomerase type II, C-terminal cupin domain. This family includes the C-terminal cupin domain of mannose-6-phosphate isomerases (MPIs) which have been classified broadly into two groups, type I and type II, based on domain organization. This family contains type II phosphomannose isomerase (also known as PMI-GDP, phosphomannose isomerase/GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase), a bifunctional enzyme with two domains that catalyze the first and third steps in the GDP-mannose pathway in which fructose 6-phosphate is converted to GDP-D-mannose. The N-terminal domain catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step, the isomerization from D-fructose-6-phosphate to D-mannose-6-phosphate, while the C-terminal cupin domain (represented in this alignment model) converts mannose 1-phosphate to GDP-D-mannose in the final step of the reaction. Although these two domains occur together in one protein in most organisms, they occur as separate proteins in certain cyanobacterial organisms. Also, although type I and type II MPIs have no overall sequence similarity, they share a conserved catalytic motif.</td>

TM1287 shows a cupin fold with a conserved "jelly roll-like" beta-barrel fold and forms a homodimer.</td>

Its biological function is still unknown. This family also includes Halorhodospira halophila Hhal_0468.

RmlC is a dTDP-sugar isomerase involved in the synthesis of L-rhamnose, a saccharide required for the virulence of some pathogenic bacteria. Cupins are a functionally diverse superfamily originally discovered based on the highly conserved motif found in germin and germin-like proteins. This conserved motif forms a beta-barrel fold found in all of the cupins, giving rise to the name cupin ('cupa' is the Latin term for small barrel). The active site of members of this superfamily is generally located at the center of a conserved barrel and usually includes a metal ion. The different functional classes in this superfamily include single domain bacterial isomerases and epimerases involved in the modification of cell wall carbohydrates, two domain bicupins such as the desiccation-tolerant seed storage globulins, and multidomain nuclear transcription factors involved in legume root nodulation.</td>

Members of this family contain an N-terminal cupin domain and a C-terminal AraC/XylS family helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain, similar to Escherichia coli 4-hydroxyphenylacetate catabolism regulatory protein HpaA (also known as 4HPA). HpaA is encoded by the hpaA gene which is located upstream of hpaBC. It is activated by 4-HPA, 3-HPA and phenylacetate, and represents a member of the AraC/XylS family of regulators that recognizes aromatic effectors. Proteins in this family belong to the cupin superfamily with a conserved "jelly roll-like" beta-barrel fold capable of homodimerization.</td>
