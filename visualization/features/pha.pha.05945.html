            <td id=al>MurJ/MviN, a subfamily of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE)-like proteins. Escherichia coli MurJ (MviN) has been identified as essential for murein biosynthesis. It has been suggested that MurJ functions as the peptidoglycan lipid II flippase which is involved in translocation of lipid-anchored peptidoglycan precursors across the cytoplasmic membrane, though results obtained in Bacillus subtilis seem to indicate that its MurJ homologs are not essential for growth. Some MviN family members (e.g. in Mycobacterium tuberculosis) possess an extended C-terminal region that contains an intracellular pseudo-kinase domain and an extracellular domain resembling carbohydrate-binding proteins. Proteins from the MATE family are involved in exporting metabolites across the cell membrane and are often responsible for multidrug resistance (MDR).</td>

            <td id=al>murein biosynthesis integral membrane protein MurJ. This model represents MurJ (previously MviN), a family of integral membrane proteins predicted to have ten or more transmembrane regions. Members have been suggested to act as a lipid II flippase, translocated a precursor of murein. However, it appears FtsW has that activity. Flippase activity for MurJ has not been shown.

            <td id=al>MviN-like protein. Deletion of the mviN virulence gene in Salmonella enterica serovar. Typhimurium greatly reduces virulence in a mouse model of typhoid-like disease. Open reading frames encoding homologs of MviN have since been identified in a variety of bacteria, including pathogens and non-pathogens and plant-symbionts. In the nitrogen-fixing symbiont Rhizobium tropici, mviN is required for motility. The MviM protein is predicted to be membrane-associated.</td>

The integral membrane protein SpoVB has been implicated in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan component of the spore cortex in Bacillus subtilis.
