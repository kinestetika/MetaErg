            <td id=al>cd06174 Major Facilitator Superfamily. The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) is a large and diverse group of secondary transporters that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. MFS proteins facilitate the transport across cytoplasmic or internal membranes of a variety of substrates including ions, sugar phosphates, drugs, neurotransmitters, nucleosides, amino acids, and peptides. They do so using the electrochemical potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins have medical significance in humans such as the glucose transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen storage disease when mutated.</td>

NepI and PbuE are involved in the efflux of purine ribonucleosides such as guanosine, adenosine and inosine, as well as purine bases like guanine, adenine, and hypoxanthine, and purine base analogs. They play a role in the maintenance of cellular purine base pools, as well as in protecting the cells and conferring resistance against toxic purine base analogs such as 6-mercaptopurine. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds.

MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds.

It is localized at the apical membrane surface of renal proximal tubules and may act as an organic cation/proton antiporter. It functions as a tumor suppressor in several cancer types including glioblastoma and colorectal cancer. SLC22A18 belongs to the Eukaryotic Solute carrier 46 (SLC46)/Bacterial Tetracycline resistance (TetA) -like (SLC46/TetA-like) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters. MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR00711 drug resistance transporter, EmrB/QacA subfamily. This subfamily of drug efflux proteins, a part of the major faciliator family, is predicted to have 14 potential membrane-spanning regions. Members with known activities include EmrB (multiple drug resistance efflux pump) in E. coli, FarB (antibacterial fatty acid resistance) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, TcmA (tetracenomycin C resistance) in Streptomyces glaucescens, etc. In most cases, the efflux pump is described as having a second component encoded in the same operon, such as EmrA of E. coli.

            <td id=al>cd17502 Saccharomyces cerevisiae Azole resistance protein 1 (Azr1p), and similar multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily. This subfamily is composed of multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters including various Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins such as azole resistance protein 1 (Azr1p), vacuolar basic amino acid transporter 1 (Vba1p), vacuolar basic amino acid transporter 5 (Vba5p), and Sge1p (also known as Nor1p, 10-N-nonyl acridine orange resistance protein, and crystal violet resistance protein). MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. This subfamily belongs to the Methylenomycin A resistance protein (also called MMR peptide) and similar multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters (MMR-like MDR transporter) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters. MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17385 Solute carrier family 18 member B1 of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. Solute carrier family 18 member B1 (SLC18B1) is the fourth member of the SLC18 transporter family, which includes vesicular monoamine transporters and vesicular acetylcholine transporter. It is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus and is associated with vesicles in astrocytes. It actively transports spermine and spermidine by exchange of H(+), and has been suggested to be a vesicular polyamine transporter (VPAT). SLC18B1 belongs to the bacterial MdtG-like and eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters. MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17333 Bacterial fucose permease, eukaryotic Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 4, and similar proteins. This family is composed of bacterial L-fucose permease (FucP), eukaryotic Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 4 (MFSD4) proteins, and similar proteins.  L-fucose permease facilitates the uptake of L-fucose across the boundary membrane with the concomitant transport of protons into the cell; it can also transport L-galactose and D-arabinose. The MFSD4 subfamily consists of two vertebrate members: MFSD4A and MFSD4B. The function of MFSD4A is unknown. MFSD4B is more commonly know as Sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (NaGLT1), a primary fructose transporter in rat renal brush-border membranes that also facilitates sodium-independent urea uptake. The FucP/MFSD4 family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17323 Yeast Polyamine transporter 1 (Tpo1) and similar multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters of the Major Facilitator Superfamily. This family is composed of fungal multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters including several proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae such as polyamine transporters 1-4 (Tpo1-4), quinidine resistance proteins 1-3 (Qdr1-3), dityrosine transporter 1 (Dtr1), fluconazole resistance protein 1 (Flr1), and protein HOL1. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. For example, Flr1 confers resistance to the azole derivative fluconazole while Tpo1 confers resistance and adaptation to quinidine and ketoconazole. The polyamine transporters are involved in the detoxification of excess polyamines in the cytoplasm. Tpo1-like MDR transporters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>
