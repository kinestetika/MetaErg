FNR transfers electrons from reduced ferredoxin to FAD (forming FADH2 via a semiquinone intermediate) and then transfers a hydride ion to convert NADP+ to NADPH. FNR has since been shown to utilize a variety of electron acceptors and donors and has a variety of physiological functions including nitrogen assimilation, dinitrogen fixation, steroid hydroxylation, fatty acid metabolism, oxygenase activity, and methane assimilation in many organisms. FNR has an NAD(P)-binding sub-domain of the alpha/beta class and a discrete (usually N-terminal) flavin sub-domain which vary in orientation with respect to the NAD(P) binding domain. The N-terminal moeity may contain a flavin prosthetic group (as in flavoenzymes) or use flavin as a substrate. Because flavins such as FAD can exist in oxidized, semiquinone (one- electron reduced), or fully reduced hydroquinone forms, FNR can interact with one and 2 electron carriers.

As a Class I bacterial dioxygenases, benzoate dioxygenase like proteins combine an [2Fe-2S] cluster containing N-terminal ferredoxin at the end fused to an FAD/NADP(P) domain.  In dioxygenase FAD/NAD(P) binding domain, the reductase transfers 2 electrons from NAD(P)H to the oxygenase which insert into an aromatic substrate, an initial step in microbial aerobic degradation of aromatic rings. Flavin oxidoreductases use flavins as substrates, unlike flavoenzymes which have a flavin prosthetic group.</td>

(Na+-NQR) is distinct from H+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductases and noncoupled NADH:quinone oxidoreductases. The NAD(P) binding domain of ferredoxin reductase-like proteins catalyze electron transfer between an NAD(P)-binding domain of the alpha/beta class and a discrete (usually N-terminal) domain which vary in orientation with respect to the NAD(P) binding domain.

Duox enzymes link a peroxidase domain to the NOX domain via a single  transmembrane and EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites. The flavoprotein module has a ferredoxin like FAD/NADPH binding domain.

Although structurally homologous to FNR, PDR binds FMN rather than FAD in it's FNR-like domain. Electron transfer between pyrimidines and iron-sulfur clusters (Rieske center [2Fe-2S]) or heme groups is mediated by flavins in respiration, photosynthesis, and oxygenase systems. Type I dioxygenase systems, including the hydroxylate phthalate system, have 2 components, a monomeric reductase consisting of a flavin and a 2Fe-2S center and a multimeric oxygenase. In contrast to other Rieske dioxygenases the ferredoxin like domain is C-, not N-terminal.</td>

Mutations in the sequence of cytochrome B-245 heavy chain (gp91-phox) lead to the X-linked chronic granulomatous disease.

Ferredoxin-NADP+ (oxido)reductase is an FAD-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible electron transfer between NADP(H) and electron carrier proteins such as ferredoxin and flavodoxin. Isoforms of these flavoproteins (i.e. having a non-covalently bound FAD as a prosthetic group) are present in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria in which they participate in a wide variety of redox metabolic pathways. The C-terminal domain contains most of the NADP(H) binding residues and the N-terminal domain interacts non-covalently with the isoalloxazine rings of the flavin molecule which lies largely in a large gap betweed the two domains. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase first accepts one electron from reduced ferredoxin to form a flavin semiquinone intermediate. The enzyme then accepts a second electron to form FADH2 which then transfers two electrons and a proton to NADP+ to form NADPH.</td>
