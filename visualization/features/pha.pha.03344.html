            <td id=al>cd03214 ATP-binding component of iron-siderophores, vitamin B12 and hemin transporters and related proteins. ABC transporters, involved in the uptake of siderophores, heme, and vitamin B12, are widely conserved in bacteria and archaea. Only very few species lack representatives of the siderophore family transporters. The E. coli BtuCD protein is an ABC transporter mediating vitamin B12 uptake. The two ATP-binding cassettes (BtuD) are in close contact with each other, as are the two membrane-spanning subunits (BtuC); this arrangement is distinct from that observed for the E. coli lipid flippase MsbA. The BtuC subunits provide 20 transmembrane helices grouped around a translocation pathway that is closed to the cytoplasm by a gate region, whereas the dimer arrangement of the BtuD subunits resembles the ATP-bound form of the Rad50 DNA repair enzyme. A prominent cytoplasmic loop of BtuC forms the contact region with the ATP-binding cassette and represent a conserved motif among the ABC transporters.</td>

The ABC transporter subfamily specific for the transport of dipeptides, oligopeptides (OppD), and nickel (NikDE). The NikABCDE system of E. coli belongs to this family and is composed of the periplasmic binding protein NikA, two integral membrane components (NikB and NikC), and two ATPase (NikD and NikE). The NikABCDE transporter is synthesized under anaerobic conditions to meet the increased demand for nickel resulting from hydrogenase synthesis. The molecular mechanism of nickel uptake in many bacteria and most archaea is not known. Many other members of this ABC family are also involved in the uptake of dipeptides and oligopeptides. The oligopeptide transport system (Opp) is a five-component ABC transport composed of a membrane-anchored substrate binding proteins (SRP), OppA, two transmembrane proteins, OppB and OppC, and two ATP-binding domains, OppD and OppF.</td>

Domain I of the ABC component of a cobalt transport family found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota. The transition metal cobalt is an essential component of many enzymes and must be transported into cells in appropriate amounts when needed. This ABC transport system of the CbiMNQO family is involved in cobalt transport in association with the cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthetic pathways. Most of cobalt (Cbi) transport systems possess a separate CbiN component, the cobalt-binding periplasmic protein, and they are encoded by the conserved gene cluster cbiMNQO. Both the CbiM and CbiQ proteins are integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins, and the CbiO protein has the linker peptide and the Walker A and B motifs commonly found in the ATPase components of the ABC-type transport systems.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03267 ATP-binding cassette domain of an uncharacterized transporter similar in sequence to NatA. NatA is the ATPase component of a bacterial ABC-type Na+ transport system called NatAB, which catalyzes ATP-dependent electrogenic Na+ extrusion without mechanically coupled to proton or K+ uptake. NatB possess six putative membrane spanning regions at its C-terminus. In B. subtilis, NatAB is inducible by agents such as ethanol and protonophores, which lower the proton-motive force across the membrane. The closest sequence similarity to NatA is exhibited by DrrA of the two-component daunorubicin- and doxorubicin-efflux system. Hence, the functional NatAB is presumably assembled with two copies of the single ATP-binding protein and the single integral membrane protein.</td>

RLI s are not transport proteins and thus cluster with a group of soluble proteins that lack the transmembrane components commonly found in other members of the family. Structurally, RLIs have an N-terminal Fe-S domain and two nucleotide binding domains which are arranged to form two composite active sites in their interface cleft. RLI is one of the most conserved enzymes between archaea and eukaryotes with a sequence identity more than 48%. The high degree of evolutionary conservation suggests that RLI performs a central role in archaeal and eukaryotic physiology.</td>

In the maltose transport system, the periplasmic maltose binding protein (MBP) stimulates the ATPase activity of the membrane-associated transporter, which consists of two transmembrane subunits, MalF and MalG, and two copies of the ATP binding subunit, MalK, and becomes tightly bound to the transporter in the catalytic transition state, ensuring that maltose is passed to the transporter as ATP is hydrolyzed.</td>

TAP (Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing) is essential for peptide delivery from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where these peptides are loaded on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecules. Loaded MHC I leave the ER and display their antigenic cargo on the cell surface to cytotoxic T cells. Subsequently, virus-infected or malignantly transformed cells can be eliminated. TAP belongs to the large family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which translocate a vast variety of solutes across membranes.</td>

ABC transporters are a large family of proteins involved in the transport of a wide variety of different compounds, like sugars, ions, peptides and more complex organic molecules. The nucleotide binding domain shows the highest similarity between all members of the family. ABC transporters are a subset of nucleotide hydrolases that contain a signature motif, Q-loop, and H-loop/switch region in addition to the Walker A motif/P-loop and Walker B motif commonly found in a number of ATP- and GTP-binding and hydrolyzing proteins.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03234 White pigment protein homolog of ABCG transporter subfamily. The White subfamily represents ABC transporters homologous to the Drosophila white gene, which acts as a dimeric importer for eye pigment precursors. The eye pigmentation of Drosophila is developed from the synthesis and deposition in the cells of red pigments, which are synthesized from guanine, and brown pigments, which are synthesized from tryptophan. The pigment precursors are encoded by the white, brown, and scarlet genes, respectively. Evidence from genetic and biochemical studies suggest that the White and Brown proteins function as heterodimers to import guanine, while the White and Scarlet proteins function to import tryptophan. However, a recent study also suggests that White may be involved in the transport of a metabolite, such as 3-hydroxykynurenine, across intracellular membranes. Mammalian ABC transporters belonging to the White subfamily (ABCG1, ABCG5, and ABCG8) have been shown to be involved in the regulation of lipid-trafficking mechanisms in macrophages, hepatocytes, and intestinal mucosa cells. ABCG1 (ABC8), the human homolog of the Drosophila white gene is induced in monocyte-derived macrophages during cholesterol influx mediated by acetylated low-density lipoprotein. It is possible that human ABCG1 forms heterodimers with several heterologous partners.</td>

NatA is the ATPase component of a bacterial ABC-type Na+ transport system called NatAB, which catalyzes ATP-dependent electrogenic Na+ extrusion without mechanically coupled proton or K+ uptake. NatB possess six putative membrane spanning regions at its C-terminus. In B. subtilis, NatAB is inducible by agents such as ethanol and protonophores, which lower the proton-motive force across the membrane. The closest sequence similarity to NatA is exhibited by DrrA of the two-component daunorubicin- and doxorubicin-efflux system. Hence, the functional NatAB is presumably assembled with two copies of a single ATP-binding protein and a single integral membrane protein.</td>

This family represents the ABC component of the protease secretion system PrtD, a 60-kDa integral membrane protein sharing 37% identity with HlyB, the ABC component of the alpha-hemolysin secretion pathway, in the C-terminal domain. They export degradative enzymes by using a type I protein secretion system and lack an N-terminal signal peptide, but contain a C-terminal secretion signal. The Type I secretion apparatus is made up of three components, an ABC transporter, a membrane fusion protein (MFP), and an outer membrane protein (OMP). For the HlyA transporter complex, HlyB (ABC transporter) and HlyD (MFP) reside in the inner membrane of E. coli. The OMP component is TolC, which is thought to interact with the MFP to form a continuous channel across the periplasm from the cytoplasm to the exterior. HlyB belongs to the family of ABC transporters, which are ubiquitous, ATP-dependent transmembrane pumps or channels. The spectrum of transport substrates ranges from inorganic ions, nutrients such as amino acids, sugars, or peptides, hydrophobic drugs, to large polypeptides, such as HlyA.</td>

The genes yhbG and yhbN are located in a single operon and may function together in cell envelope during biogenesis. YhbG is the putative ATP-binding cassette component and YhbN is the putative periplasmic-binding protein. Depletion of each gene product leads to growth arrest, irreversible cell damage and loss of viability in E. coli. The YhbG homolog (NtrA) is essential in Rhizobium meliloti, a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03253 ATP-binding cassette domain of iron-sulfur clusters transporter, subfamily C. ATM1 is an ABC transporter that is expressed in the mitochondria. Although the specific function of ATM1 is unknown, its disruption results in the accumulation of excess mitochondrial iron, loss of mitochondrial cytochromes, oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA, and decreased levels of cytosolic heme proteins. ABC transporters are a large family of proteins involved in the transport of a wide variety of different compounds, like sugars, ions, peptides, and more complex organic molecules. The nucleotide binding domain shows the highest similarity between all members of the family. ABC transporters are a subset of nucleotide hydrolases that contain a signature motif, Q-loop, and H-loop/switch region, in addition to, the Walker A motif/P-loop and Walker B motif commonly found in a number of ATP- and GTP-binding and hydrolyzing proteins.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03262 ATP-binding cassette domain of the histidine and glutamine transporters. HisP and GlnQ are the ATP-binding components of the bacterial periplasmic histidine and glutamine permeases, respectively. Histidine permease is a multi-subunit complex containing the HisQ and HisM integral membrane subunits and two copies of HisP. HisP has properties intermediate between those of integral and peripheral membrane proteins and is accessible from both sides of the membrane, presumably by its interaction with HisQ and HisM. The two HisP subunits form a homodimer within the complex. The domain structure of the amino acid uptake systems is typical for prokaryotic extracellular solute binding protein-dependent uptake systems. All of the amino acid uptake systems also have at least one, and in a few cases, two extracellular solute binding proteins located in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, or attached to the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. The best-studied member of the PAAT (polar amino acid transport) family is the HisJQMP system of S. typhimurium, where HisJ is the extracellular solute binding proteins and HisP is the ABC protein.</td>

The MRP (Multidrug Resistance Protein)-like transporters are involved in drug, peptide, and lipid export. They belong to the subfamily C of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins. The ABCC subfamily contains transporters with a diverse functional spectrum that includes ion transport, cell surface receptor, and toxin secretion activities. The MRP-like family, similar to all ABC proteins, have a common four-domain core structure constituted by two membrane-spanning domains, each composed of six transmembrane (TM) helices, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD). ABC transporters are a subset of nucleotide hydrolases that contain a signature motif, Q-loop, and H-loop/switch region, in addition to, the Walker A motif/P-loop and Walker B motif commonly found in a number of ATP- and GTP-binding and hydrolyzing proteins.</td>

This conserved sequence, LSGG, is the most specific and characteristic motif of this family and is thus known as the ABC signature sequence.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR02857 thiol reductant ABC exporter, CydD subunit. The gene pair cydCD encodes an ABC-family transporter in which each gene contains an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain (pfam00664) and a C-terminal ATP-binding domain (pfam00005). In E. coli these genes were discovered as mutants which caused the terminal heme-copper oxidase complex cytochrome bd to fail to assemble. Recent work has shown that the transporter is involved in export of redox-active thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione. The linkage to assembly of the cytochrome bd complex is further supported by the conserved operon structure found outside the gammaproteobacteria (cydABCD) containing both the transporter and oxidase genes components. The genes used as the seed members for this model are all either found in the gammproteobacterial context or the CydABCD context. All members of this family scoring above trusted at the time of its creation were from genomes which encode a cytochrome bd complex. Unfortunately, the gene symbol nomenclature adopted based on this operon in B. subtilis assigns cydC to the third gene in the operon where this gene is actually homologous to the E. coli cydD gene. We have chosen to name all homologs in this family in accordance with the precedence of publication of the E. coli name, CydD</td>

            <td id=al>cd03268 ATP-binding cassette domain of the bacitracin-resistance transporter. The BcrA subfamily represents ABC transporters involved in peptide antibiotic resistance. Bacitracin is a dodecapeptide antibiotic produced by B. licheniformis and B. subtilis. The synthesis of bacitracin is non-ribosomally catalyzed by a multi-enzyme complex BcrABC. Bacitracin has potent antibiotic activity against gram-positive bacteria. The inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis is the best characterized bacterial effect of bacitracin. The bacitracin resistance of B. licheniformis is mediated by the ABC transporter Bcr which is composed of two identical BcrA ATP-binding subunits and one each of the integral membrane proteins, BcrB and BcrC. B. subtilis cells carrying bcr genes on high-copy number plasmids develop collateral detergent sensitivity, a similar phenomenon in human cells with overexpressed multi-drug resistance P-glycoprotein.</td>

MTABC3 (also known as ABCB6) is a mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette protein involved in iron homeostasis and one of four ABC transporters expressed in the mitochondrial inner membrane, the other three being MDL1(ABC7), MDL2, and ATM1. In fact, the yeast MDL1 (multidrug resistance-like protein 1) and MDL2 (multidrug resistance-like protein 2) transporters are also included in this CD. MDL1 is an ATP-dependent permease that acts as a high-copy suppressor of ATM1 and is thought to have a role in resistance to oxidative stress. Interestingly, subfamily B is more closely related to the carboxyl-terminal component of subfamily C than the two halves of ABCC molecules are with one another.</td>
