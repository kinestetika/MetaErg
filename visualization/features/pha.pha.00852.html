            <td id=al>phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosyltransferase. This family is most closely related to the GT4 family of glycosyltransferases and named after PimA in Propionibacterium freudenreichii, which is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIM) which are early precursors in the biosynthesis of lipomannans (LM) and lipoarabinomannans (LAM), and catalyzes the addition of a mannosyl residue from GDP-D-mannose (GDP-Man) to the position 2 of the carrier lipid phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) to generate a phosphatidyl-myo-inositol bearing an alpha-1,2-linked mannose residue (PIM1). Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. The acceptor molecule can be a lipid, a protein, a heterocyclic compound, or another carbohydrate residue. This group of glycosyltransferases is most closely related to the previously defined glycosyltransferase family 1 (GT1). The members of this family may transfer UDP, ADP, GDP, or CMP linked sugars. The diverse enzymatic activities among members of this family reflect a wide range of biological functions. The protein structure available for this family has the GTB topology, one of the two protein topologies observed for nucleotide-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases. GTB proteins have distinct N- and C- terminal domains each containing a typical Rossmann fold. The two domains have high structural homology despite minimal sequence homology. The large cleft that separates the two domains includes the catalytic center and permits a high degree of flexibility. The members of this family are found mainly in certain bacteria and archaea.</td>

A deficiency of this enzyme causes an abnormal accumulation of Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, which is associated with a type of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), designated CDG-Ii, in humans.</td>

            <td id=al>glycosyltransferase ExpE7 and similar proteins. This family is most closely related to the GT4 family of glycosyltransferases. ExpE7 in Sinorhizobium meliloti has been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of galactoglucans (exopolysaccharide II).</td>

            <td id=al>Glycogen synthase GlgA and similar proteins. This family is most closely related to the GT5 family of glycosyltransferases. Glycogen synthase (EC:2.4.1.21) catalyzes the formation and elongation of the alpha-1,4-glucose backbone using ADP-glucose, the second and key step of glycogen biosynthesis. This family includes starch synthases of plants, such as DULL1 in Zea mays and glycogen synthases of various organisms.</td>

            <td id=al>amylovoran biosynthesis glycosyltransferase AmsK and similar proteins. This family is most closely related to the GT4 family of glycosyltransferases. AmsK is involved in the biosynthesis of amylovoran, which functions as a virulence factor. It functions as a glycosyl transferase which transfers galactose from UDP-galactose to a lipid-linked amylovoran-subunit precursor.  The members of this family are found mainly in bacteria and Archaea.</td>
