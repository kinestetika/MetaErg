            <td id=al>cd04682 Members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily catalyze the hydrolysis of NUcleoside DIphosphates linked to other moieties, X. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily require a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, for their activity and contain a highly conserved 23-residue nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), which functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. Substrates of nudix hydrolases include intact and oxidatively damaged nucleoside triphosphates, dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide-sugars and dinucleotide enzymes. These substrates are metabolites or cell signaling molecules that require regulation during different stages of the cell cycle or during periods of stress. In general, the role of the nudix hydrolase is to sanitize the nucleotide pools and to maintain cell viability, thereby serving as surveillance & "house-cleaning" enzymes. Substrate specificity is used to define families within the superfamily. Differences in substrate specificity are determined by the N-terminal extension or by residues in variable loop regions. Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in the numbers and roles of divalent cations required.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03425 The MutT pyrophosphohydrolase is a prototypical Nudix hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of nucleoside and deoxynucleoside triphosphates (NTPs and dNTPs) by substitution at a beta-phosphorus to yield a nucleotide monophosphate (NMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). This enzyme requires two divalent cations for activity; one coordinates the phosphoryl groups of the NTP/dNTP substrate, and the other coordinates to the enzyme. It also contains the Nudix motif, a highly conserved 23-residue block (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), that functions as metal binding and catalytic site. MutT pyrophosphohydrolase is important in preventing errors in DNA replication by hydrolyzing mutagenic nucleotides such as 8-oxo-dGTP (a product of oxidative damage), which can mispair with template adenine during DNA replication, to guanine nucleotides.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03427 MutT homolog-1 (MTH1) is a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. MTH1, the mammalian counterpart of MutT, hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-hydroxy-ATP, to monophosphates, thereby preventing the incorporation of such oxygen radicals during replication. This is an important step in the repair mechanism in genomic and mitochondrial DNA.  Like other members of the Nudix family, it requires a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, for activity, and contain the Nudix motif, a highly conserved 23-residue block (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. MTH1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Structurally, this enzyme adopts a similar fold to MutT despite low sequence similarity outside the conserved nudix motif. The most distinctive structural difference between MutT and MTH1 is the presence of a beta-hairpin, which is absent in MutT. This results in a much deeper and narrower substrate binding pocket. Mechanistically, MTH1 contains dual specificity for nucleotides that contain 2-OH-adenine bases and those that contain 8-oxo-guanine bases.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02883 Nudix hydrolase is a superfamily of enzymes found in all three kingdoms of life, and it catalyzes the hydrolysis of NUcleoside DIphosphates linked to other moieties, X. Enzymes belonging to this superfamily require a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for their activity. Members of this family are recognized by a highly conserved 23-residue nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), which forms a structural motif that functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. Substrates of nudix hydrolase include intact and oxidatively damaged nucleoside triphosphates, dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide-sugars and dinucleotide enzymes. These substrates are metabolites or cell signaling molecules that require regulation during different stages of the cell cycle or during periods of stress. In general, the role of the nudix hydrolase is to sanitize the nucleotide pools and to maintain cell viability, thereby serving as surveillance and "house-cleaning" enzymes. Substrate specificity is used to define child families within the superfamily. Differences in substrate specificity are determined by the N-terminal extension or by residues in variable loop regions. Mechanistically, substrate hydrolysis occurs by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with variation in the numbers and roles of divalent cations required. This superfamily consists of at least nine families: IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) isomerase, ADP ribose pyrophosphatase, mutT pyrophosphohydrolase, coenzyme-A pyrophosphatase, MTH1-7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-triphosphatase, diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, NADH pyrophosphatase, GDP-mannose hydrolase and the c-terminal portion of the mutY adenine glycosylase.</td>
