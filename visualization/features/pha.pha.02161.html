Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase 1 (SSADH1, GabD1, EC=1.2.1.16) catalyzes the NADP(+)-dependent oxidation of succinate semialdehyde (SSA)  to succinate.  SSADH activity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is encoded by both gabD1 (Rv0234c) and gabD2 (Rv1731).  The Mtb GabD1 SSADH1 reportedly is an enzyme of the gamma-aminobutyrate shunt, which forms a functional link between two TCA half-cycles by converting alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate.</td>

Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (SSADH, GabD, EC=1.2.1.24) catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of succinate semialdehyde (SSA) to succinate. This group includes the human aldehyde dehydrogenase family 5 member A1 (ALDH5A1) which is a mitochondrial homotetramer that converts SSA to succinate in the last step of 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) catabolism. This CD also includes the Arabidopsis SSADH gene product ALDH5F1. Mutations in this gene result in the accumulation of H2O2, suggesting a role in plant defense against the environmental stress of elevated reactive oxygen species.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07078 NAD(P)+ dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase family. The aldehyde dehydrogenase family (ALDH) of NAD(P)+ dependent enzymes, in general, oxidize a wide range of  endogenous and exogenous aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids and play an  important role in detoxification. Besides aldehyde detoxification, many ALDH isozymes possess multiple additional catalytic and non-catalytic functions such as participating in  metabolic pathways, or as  binding proteins, or as osmoregulants, to mention a few. The enzyme has three domains, a NAD(P)+ cofactor-binding domain, a catalytic domain, and a bridging domain; and the active enzyme  is generally either homodimeric or homotetrameric. The catalytic mechanism is proposed to involve cofactor binding, resulting in a conformational change and activation of an invariant catalytic cysteine nucleophile. The cysteine and aldehyde substrate form an oxyanion thiohemiacetal intermediate resulting in hydride transfer to the cofactor and formation of a thioacylenzyme intermediate. Hydrolysis of the thioacylenzyme and release of the carboxylic acid product occurs, and in most cases, the reduced cofactor dissociates from the enzyme. The evolutionary phylogenetic tree of ALDHs appears to have an initial bifurcation between what has been characterized as the classical aldehyde dehydrogenases, the ALDH family (ALDH) and extended family members or aldehyde dehydrogenase-like (ALDH-like) proteins. The ALDH proteins are represented by enzymes which share a number of highly conserved residues necessary for catalysis and cofactor binding and they include such proteins as retinal dehydrogenase, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenases, alpha-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase, alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, coniferyl aldehyde dehydrogenase and succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase.  Included in this larger group are all human, Arabidopsis, Tortula, fungal, protozoan, and Drosophila ALDHs identified in families ALDH1 through ALDH22 with the exception of families ALDH18, ALDH19, and ALDH20 which are present in the ALDH-like group.</td>

Kinetic studies of the Bacillus subtilis ALDH-like ycbD protein, which is involved in d-glucarate/d-galactarate utilization, reveal that it is a NADP+-dependent, alpha-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase (KGSADH). KGSADHs (EC 1.2.1.26) catalyze the NAD(P)+-dependent conversion of KGSA to alpha-ketoglutarate. Interestingly, the NADP+-dependent, tetrameric, 2,5-dioxopentanoate dehydrogenase (EC=1.2.1.26), an enzyme involved in the catabolic pathway for D-arabinose in Sulfolobus solfataricus, also clusters in this group.

FTHFDH catalyzes an NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase reaction resulting in the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2.

Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (AASADH, EC=1.2.1.31), also known as ALDH7A1, Antiquitin-1, ALDH7B, or delta-1-piperideine-6-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P6CDH), is a NAD+-dependent ALDH. Human ALDH7A1 is involved in the pipecolic acid pathway of lysine catabolism, catalyzing the oxidation of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde to alpha-aminoadipate.  Arabidopsis thaliana ALDH7B4 appears to be an osmotic-stress-inducible ALDH gene encoding a turgor-responsive or stress-inducible ALDH. The Streptomyces clavuligerus P6CDH appears to be involved in cephamycin biosynthesis, catalyzing the second stage of the two-step conversion of lysine to alpha-aminoadipic acid.  The ALDH7A1 enzyme and others in this group have been observed as tetramers, yet the bacterial P6CDH enzyme has been reported as a monomer.</td>

Orthologs of MaoC include PaaZ (Escherichia coli) and PaaN (Pseudomonas putida), which are putative ring-opening enzymes of the aerobic phenylacetic acid (PA) catabolic pathway. The C-terminal domain of MaoC has sequence similarity to enoyl-CoA hydratase. Also included in this CD is a novel Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 ALDH of the aerobic benzoate oxidation (box) pathway. This pathway involves first the synthesis of a CoA thio-esterified aromatic acid, with subsequent dihydroxylation and cleavage steps, yielding the CoA thio-esterified aliphatic aldehyde, 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde, which is further converted into its corresponding CoA acid by the Burkholderia LB400 ALDH.</td>
