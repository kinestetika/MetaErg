            <td id=al>Bacterial Ribonuclease HII-like. This family includes mostly bacterial type 2 RNases H, with some eukaryotic members. Bacterial RNase HII has a role in primer removal based on its involvement in ribonucleotide-specific catalytic activity in the presence of RNA/DNA hybrid substrates. Several bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, have two different type II RNases H, RNases HII and HIII; double deletion of these leads to cellular lethality. It appears that type I and type II RNases H also have overlapping functions in cells, as over-expression of Escherichia coli RNase HII can complement an RNase HI deletion phenotype. In Leishmania mitochondria, of the four distinct RNase H genes (H1, HIIA, HIIB, HIIC), HIIC is essential for the survival of the parasite and thus can be a potential target for anti-leishmanial chemotherapy. Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two families, type I (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type II (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2). RNase H endonucleolytically hydrolyzes an RNA strand when it is annealed to a complementary DNA strand in the presence of divalent cations, in DNA replication and repair.</td>

            <td id=al>Archaeal Ribonuclease HII. This family includes type 2 RNases H from archaea, some of which show broad divalent cation specificity. It is proposed that three of the four acidic residues at the active site are involved in metal binding and the fourth one is involved in the catalytic process in archaea. Most archaeal genomes contain multiple RNase H genes. Despite a lack of evidence for homology from sequence comparisons, type I and type II RNase H share a common fold and similar steric configurations of the four acidic active-site residues, suggesting identical or very similar catalytic mechanisms. It appears that type I and type II RNases H also have overlapping functions in cells, as over-expression of Escherichia coli RNase HII can complement an RNase HI deletion phenotype in E. coli. RNase H is classified into two families, type I (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type II (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, archaeal RNase HII and eukaryotic RNase H2/HII). RNase H endonucleolytically hydrolyzes an RNA strand when it is annealed to a complementary DNA strand in the presence of divalent cations, in DNA replication or repair.</td>

            <td id=al>Ribonuclease H (RNase H) type II family (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2/HII). This family contains ribonucleases HII (RNases H2) which include bacterial RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic and archaeal RNase H2/HII. RNase H2 cleaves RNA sequences that are part of RNA/DNA hybrids or that are incorporated into DNA, thereby preventing genomic instability and the accumulation of aberrant nucleic acid which can induce Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, a severe autoimmune disorder in humans. Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two families, type I (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type II (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2/HII). RNase H endonucleolytically hydrolyzes an RNA strand when it is annealed to a complementary DNA strand in the presence of divalent cations. The enzyme can be found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes, but no prokaryotic genome contains the combination of only RNase HI and HIII. Despite a lack of evidence for homology from sequence comparisons, type I and type II RNase H share a common fold and similar steric configurations of the four acidic active-site residues, suggesting identical or very similar catalytic mechanisms. It appears that type I and type II RNases H also have overlapping functions in cells, as over-expression of Escherichia coli RNase HII can complement an RNase HI deletion phenotype in E. coli.</td>

            <td id=al>Bacterial type 2 ribonuclease, HII and HIII-like. This family includes type 2 RNases H from several bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, which have two different RNases, HII and HIII. RNases HIII are distinguished by having a large (70-90 residues) N-terminal extension of unknown function. In addition, the active site of RNase HIII differs from that of other RNases H; replacing the fourth residue (aspartate) of the acidic "DEDD" motif with a glutamate. Most prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes contain multiple RNase H genes; however, no prokaryotic genomes contain the combination of both RNase HI and HIII. This mutual exclusive gene inheritance might be the result of functional redundancy of RNase HI and HIII in prokaryotes. Ribonuclease (RNase) H is classified into two families, type I (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type II (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, archaeal RNase HII and eukaryotic RNase H2/HII). RNase H endonucleolytically hydrolyzes an RNA strand when it is annealed to a complementary DNA strand in the presence of divalent cations, in DNA replication or repair.</td>

            <td id=al>Eukaryotic RNase HII. This family includes eukaryotic type 2 RNase H (RNase HII or H2) which is active during replication and is believed to play a role in the removal of Okazaki fragment primers and single ribonucleotides in DNA-DNA duplexes. Eukaryotic RNase HII (RNASEH2A) is functional when it forms a heterotrimeric complex with two other accessory proteins (RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C). It is speculated that these accessory subunits are required for correct folding of the catalytic subunit of RNase HII. Mutations in the three subunits of human RNase HII cause the severe genetic neurological disorder Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome. Ribonuclease H (RNase H) is classified into two families, type I (prokaryotic RNase HI, eukaryotic RNase H1 and viral RNase H) and type II (prokaryotic RNase HII and HIII, and eukaryotic RNase H2/HII). RNase H endonucleolytically hydrolyzes an RNA strand when it is annealed to a complementary DNA strand in the presence of divalent cations, in DNA replication and repair.
