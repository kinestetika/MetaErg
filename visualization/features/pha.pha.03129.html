            <td id=al>4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. This protein oxidizes 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, a tyrosine and phenylalanine catabolite, to homogentisate. Homogentisate can undergo a further non-enzymatic oxidation and polymerization into brown pigments that protect some bacterial species from light. A similar process occurs spontaneously in blood and is hemolytic (see . In some bacterial species, this enzyme has been studied as a hemolysin. [Energy metabolism, Amino acids and amines]</td>

            <td id=al>C-terminal domain of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HppD) and hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS). HppD and HmaS are non-heme iron-dependent dioxygenases, which modify a common substrate, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP), but yield different products. HPPD catalyzes the second reaction in tyrosine catabolism, the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, HG). HmaS converts HPP to 4-hydroxymandelate, a committed step in the formation of hydroxyphenylglycerine, a structural component of nonproteinogenic macrocyclic peptide antibiotics, such as vancomycin. If the emphasis is on catalytic chemistry, HPPD and HmaS are classified as members of a large family of alpha-keto acid dependent mononuclear non-heme iron oxygenases most of which require Fe(II), molecular oxygen, and an alpha-keto acid (typically alpha-ketoglutarate) to either oxygenate or oxidize a third substrate. Both enzymes are exceptions in that they require two, instead of three, substrates, do not use alpha-ketoglutarate, and incorporate both atoms of dioxygen into the aromatic product. Both HPPD and HmaS exhibit duplicate beta barrel topology in their N- and C-terminal domains which share sequence similarity, suggestive of a gene duplication. Each protein has only one catalytic site located in at the C-terminal domain. This HPPD_C_like domain represents the C-terminal domain.</td>

            <td id=al>Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MMCE). MMCE, also called methylmalonyl-CoA racemase (EC 5.1.99.1) interconverts (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA and (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. MMCE has been found in bacteria, archaea, and in animals. In eukaryotes, MMCE is an essential enzyme in a pathway that converts propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, and is important in the breakdown of odd-chain length fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, and other metabolites. In bacteria, MMCE participates in the reverse pathway for propionate fermentation, glyoxylate regeneration, and the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics. MMCE is closely related to glyoxalase I and type I extradiol dioxygenases.</td>
