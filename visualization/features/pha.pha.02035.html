            <td id=al>Endo-N-acetylmuramidases (muramidases) are lysozymes (also referred to as peptidoglycan hydrolases) that degrade bacterial cell walls by catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues.  This family of muramidases contains a glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25) catalytic domain and is found in bacteria, fungi, slime molds, round worms, protozoans and bacteriophages.  The bacteriophage members are referred to as endolysins which are involved in lysing the host cell at the end of the replication cycle to allow release of mature phage particles.  Endolysins are typically modular enzymes consisting of a catalytically active domain that hydrolyzes the peptidoglycan cell wall and a cell wall-binding domain that anchors the protein to the cell wall.  Endolysins generally have narrow substrate specificities with either intra-species or intra-genus bacteriolytic activity.</td>

            <td id=al>CH-type (Chalaropsis-type) lysozymes represent one of four functionally-defined classes of peptidoglycan hydrolases (also referred to as endo-N-acetylmuramidases) that cleave bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans.  CH-type lysozymes exhibit both lysozyme (acetylmuramidase) and diacetylmuramidase activity. The first member of this family to be described was a muramidase from the fungus Chalaropsis.  However, a majority of the CH-type lysozymes are found in bacteriophages and Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptomyces and Clostridium.  CH-type lysozymes have a single glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25) domain with an unusual beta/alpha-barrel fold in which the last strand of the barrel is antiparallel to strands beta7 and beta1.  Most CH-type lysozymes appear to lack the cell wall-binding domain found in other GH25 muramidases.</td>

LytC is composed of a C-terminal glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25) domain and an N-terminal choline-binding module (CBM) consisting of eleven homologous repeats that specifically recognizes the choline residues of pneumococcal lipoteichoic and teichoic acids. This domain arrangement is the reverse of the major pneumococcal autolysin, LytA, and the CPL-1-like lytic enzymes of the pneumococcal bacteriophages, in which the CBM (consisting of six repeats) is at the C-terminus. This model represents the C-terminal catalytic domain of the LytC-like enzymes.</td>

The N-terminal glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25) domain of LysA has sequence similarity with other murein hydrolase catalytic domains while the C-terminal domain has sequence similarity with putative bacterial cell wall-binding SH3b domains.

PlyB has an N-terminal glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25) catalytic domain and a C-terminal bacterial SH3-like domain, SH3b.  Both domains are required for effective catalytic activity.  Endolysins are produced by bacteriophages at the end of their life cycle and participate in lysing the bacterial cell in order to release the newly formed progeny.  Endolysins (also referred to as endo-N-acetylmuramidases or peptidoglycan hydrolases) degrade bacterial cell walls by catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues.</td>

This family includes the AtlA and Aml autolysins from Streptococcus mutans which have a C-terminal glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25) catalytic domain as well as six tandem N-terminal repeats of the GBS (group B Streptococcus) Bsp-like peptidoglycan-binding domain.  Other members of this family have one or more C-terminal peptidoglycan-binding domain(s) (SH3 or LysM) in addition to the GH25 domain.</td>

            <td id=al>Cpl-1 lysin (also known as Cpl-9 lysozyme / muramidase) is a bacterial cell wall endolysin encoded by the pneumococcal bacteriophage Cp-1, which cleaves the glycosidic N-acetylmuramoyl-(beta1,4)-N-acetylglucosamine bonds of the pneumococcal glycan chain, thus acting as an enzymatic antimicrobial agent (an enzybiotic) against streptococcal infections. Cpl-1 belongs to the CP family of lysozymes (CPL lysozymes) which includes the Cpl-7 lysin.  Cpl-1 has a glycosyl hydrolase family 25 (GH25) catalytic domain with an irregular (beta/alpha)5-beta3 barrel and a C-terminal cell wall-anchoring module formed by six similar choline-binding repeats (ChBr's). The ChBr's facilitate the anchoring of Cpl-1 to the choline-containing teichoic acid of the pneumococcal cell wall. Other members of this domain family have an N-terminal CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases) domain similar to that of the firmicute CHAP lysins and associated with endopeptidase activity.  The Cpl-7 lysin is also included here as is LysB of Lactococcus phage, and the Mur lysin of Lactobacillus phage.</td>
