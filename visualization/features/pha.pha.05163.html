            <td id=al>cd08021 M20 Peptidase aminoacylase 1 subfamily, includes Bacillus subtilis YhaA and Staphylococcus aureus amidohydrolase, SACOL0085. Peptidase M20 family, uncharacterized subfamily of bacterial proteins predicted as putative amidohydrolases or hippurate hydrolases. These are a class of zinc binding homodimeric enzymes involved in hydrolysis of N-acetylated proteins. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process that is involved in protection and stability of proteins. Several types of aminoacylases can be distinguished on the basis of substrate specificity. Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) breaks down cytosolic aliphatic N-acyl-alpha-amino acids (except L-aspartate), especially N-acetyl-methionine and acetyl-glutamate into L-amino acids and an acyl group. However, ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. ACY1 may also play a role in xenobiotic bioactivation as well as the inter-organ processing of amino acid-conjugated xenobiotic derivatives (S-substituted-N-acetyl-L-cysteine). This family includes Staphylococcus aureus amidohydrolase, SACOL0085, which contains two manganese ions in the active site, and forms a homotetramer with variations in interdomain orientation which possibly plays a role in the regulation of catalytic activity.</td>

Peptidase M20 family, Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1; hippuricase; acylase I; amido acid deacylase; IAA-amino acid hydrolase; dehydropeptidase II; N-acyl-L-amino-acid amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.14) subfamily. ACY1 is the most abundant of the aminoacylases, a class of zinc binding homodimeric enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of N-acetylated proteins. It is encoded by the aminoacylase 1 gene (Acy1) on chromosome 3p21 that comprises 15 exons. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process that is involved in the protection and stability of proteins. Several types of aminoacylases can be distinguished on the basis of substrate specificity; substrates include indoleacetic acid (IAA) N-conjugates of amino acids, N-acetyl-L-amino acids and aminobenzoylglutamate. ACY1 breaks down cytosolic aliphatic N-acyl-alpha-amino acids (except L-aspartate), especially N-acetyl-methionine and acetyl-glutamate into L-amino acids and an acyl group. However, ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. ACY1 may also play a role in xenobiotic bioactivation as well as the inter-organ processing of amino acid-conjugated xenobiotic derivatives (S-substituted-N-acetyl-L-cysteine). ACY1 appears to physically interact with Sphingosine kinase type 1 (SphK1) and may influence its physiological functions; SphK1 and its product sphingosine-1-phosphate have been shown to promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells. Strong expression of the human gene and its mouse ortholog Acy1 in brain, liver, and kidney, suggest a role of the enzyme in amino acid metabolism of these organs. Defects in ACY1 are the cause of aminoacylase-1 deficiency (ACY1D), resulting in a metabolic disorder manifesting encephalopathy and psychomotor delay.</td>

Peptidase M20 family, plant aminoacyclase-1 indole-3-acetic-L-aspartic acid hydrolase (IAA-Asp hydrolase; IAAspH; IAAH; IAA amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.-) subfamily. IAAspH hydrolyzes indole-3-acetyl-N-aspartic acid (IAA or auxin) to indole-3-acetic acid. Genes encoding IAA-amidohydrolases were first cloned from Arabidopsis; ILR1, IAR3, ILL1 and ILL2 encode active IAA- amino acid hydrolases, and three additional amidohydrolase-like genes (ILL3, ILL5, ILL6) have been isolated. In higher plants, the growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) is found both free and conjugated via amide bonding to a variety of amino acids and peptides, and via an ester linkage to carbohydrates. IAA-Asp conjugates are involved in homeostatic control, protection, storing and subsequent use of free IAA. IAA-Asp is also found in some plants as a unique intermediate for entering into IAA non-decarboxylative oxidative pathway. IAA amidohydrolase cleaves the amide bond between the auxin and the conjugated amino acid. Enterobacter agglomerans IAAspH has very strong enzyme activity and substrate specificity towards IAA-Asp, although its substrate affinity is weaker compared to Arabidopsis enzymes of the ILR1 gene family. Enhanced IAA-hydrolase activity has been observed during clubroot disease in Chinese cabbage.</td>

These are a class of zinc binding homodimeric enzymes involved in hydrolysis of N-acetylated proteins. N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process that is involved in protection and stability of proteins. Several types of aminoacylases can be distinguished on the basis of substrate specificity. Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) breaks down cytosolic aliphatic N-acyl-alpha-amino acids (except L-aspartate), especially N-acetyl-methionine and acetyl-glutamate into L-amino acids and an acyl group. However, ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids. ACY1 may also play a role in xenobiotic bioactivation as well as the inter-organ processing of amino acid-conjugated xenobiotic derivatives (S-substituted-N-acetyl-L-cysteine).</td>

Peptidase M20 family, bacterial and archaeal aminoacyclase-1 indole-3-acetic-L-aspartic acid hydrolase (IAA-Asp hydrolase; IAAspH; IAAH; IAA amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.-) subfamily. IAAspH hydrolyzes indole-3-acetyl-N-aspartic acid (IAA or auxin) to indole-3-acetic acid. Genes encoding IAA-amidohydrolases were first cloned from Arabidopsis; ILR1, IAR3, ILL1 and ILL2 encode active IAA- amino acid hydrolases, and three additional amidohydrolase-like genes (ILL3, ILL5, ILL6) have been isolated. In higher plants, the growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) is found both free and conjugated via amide bonding to a variety of amino acids and peptides, and via an ester linkage to carbohydrates. IAA-Asp conjugates are involved in homeostatic control, protection, storing and subsequent use of free IAA. IAA-Asp is also found in some plants as a unique intermediate for entering into IAA non-decarboxylative oxidative pathway. IAA amidohydrolase cleaves the amide bond between the auxin and the conjugated amino acid. Enterobacter agglomerans IAAspH has very strong enzyme activity and substrate specificity towards IAA-Asp, although its substrate affinity is weaker compared to Arabidopsis enzymes of the ILR1 gene family. Enhanced IAA-hydrolase activity has been observed during clubroot disease in Chinese cabbage.</td>

It catalyzes the release of N-terminal amino acids with hydrophobic side chains from tripeptides with high specificity; dipeptides, tetrapeptides or tripeptides with the N-terminus blocked are not cleaved.

            <td id=al>cd03873 Zinc peptidases M18, M20, M28, and M42. Zinc peptidases play vital roles in metabolic and signaling pathways throughout all kingdoms of life. This hierarchy contains zinc peptidases that correspond to the MH clan in the MEROPS database, which contains 4 families (M18, M20, M28, M42). The peptidase M20 family includes carboxypeptidases such as the glutamate carboxypeptidase from Pseudomonas, the thermostable carboxypeptidase Ss1 of broad specificity from archaea and yeast Gly-X carboxypeptidase. The dipeptidases include bacterial dipeptidase, peptidase V (PepV), a non-specific eukaryotic dipeptidase, and two Xaa-His dipeptidases (carnosinases). There is also the bacterial aminopeptidase, peptidase T (PepT) that acts only on tripeptide substrates and has therefore been termed a tripeptidase. Peptidase family M28 contains aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases, and has co-catalytic zinc ions. However, several enzymes in this family utilize other first row transition metal ions such as cobalt and manganese. Each zinc ion is tetrahedrally co-ordinated, with three amino acid ligands plus activated water; one aspartate residue binds both metal ions. The aminopeptidases in this family are also called bacterial leucyl aminopeptidases, but are able to release a variety of N-terminal amino acids. IAP aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase Y preferentially release basic amino acids while glutamate carboxypeptidase II preferentially releases C-terminal glutamates. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II and plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase hydrolyze dipeptides. Peptidase families M18 and M42 contain metallo-aminopeptidases. M18 is widely distributed in bacteria and eukaryotes. However, only yeast aminopeptidase I and mammalian aspartyl aminopeptidase have been characterized in detail. Some M42 (also known as glutamyl aminopeptidase) enzymes exhibit aminopeptidase specificity while others also have acylaminoacyl-peptidase activity (i.e. hydrolysis of acylated N-terminal residues).</td>

The peptidase M20 family contains exopeptidases, including carboxypeptidases such as the glutamate carboxypeptidase from Pseudomonas, the thermostable carboxypeptidase Ss1 of broad specificity from archaea and yeast Gly-X carboxypeptidase, dipeptidases such as bacterial dipeptidase, peptidase V (PepV), a eukaryotic, non-specific dipeptidase, and two Xaa-His dipeptidases (carnosinases). This family also includes the bacterial aminopeptidase peptidase T (PepT) that acts only on tripeptide substrates and has therefore been termed a tripeptidase. These peptidases generally hydrolyze the late products of protein degradation so as to complete the conversion of proteins to free amino acids. Glutamate carboxypeptidase hydrolyzes folate analogs such as methotrexate, and therefore can be used to treat methotrexate toxicity. Peptidase families M18 and M42 contain metallo-aminopeptidases. M18 (aspartyl aminopeptidase, DAP) family cleaves only unblocked N-terminal acidic amino-acid residues and is highly selective for hydrolyzing aspartate or glutamate residues. Some M42 (also known as glutamyl aminopeptidase) enzymes exhibit aminopeptidase specificity while others also have acylaminoacyl-peptidase activity (i.e. hydrolysis of acylated N-terminal residues).</td>
