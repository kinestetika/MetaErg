            <td id=al>Largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), N-terminal domain. This region represents the N-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP). RNAP is a large multi-protein complex responsible for the synthesis of RNA. It is the principle enzyme of the transcription process, and is a final target in many regulatory pathways that control gene expression in all living cells. At least three distinct RNAP complexes are found in eukaryotic nuclei; RNAP I transcribes the ribosomal RNA precursor, RNAP II the mRNA precursor, and RNAP III the 5S and tRNA genes. A single distinct RNAP complex is found in prokaryotes and archaea, respectively, which may be responsible for the synthesis of all RNAs. Structure studies reveal that prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs share a conserved crab-claw-shaped structure. The largest and the second largest subunits each make up one clamp, one jaw, and part of the cleft. All RNAPs are metalloenzymes. At least one Mg2+ ion is bound in the catalytic center. In addition, all cellular RNAPs contain several tightly bound zinc ions to different subunits that vary between RNAPs from prokaryotic to eukaryotic lineages. This domain represents the N-terminal region of the largest subunit of RNAP, and includes part of the active site. In archaea and some of the photosynthetic organisms or cellular organelle, however, this domain exists as a separate subunit.</td>

            <td id=al>A' subunit of archaeal RNA polymerase (RNAP). A' is the largest subunit of the archaeal RNA polymerase (RNAP). Archaeal RNAP is closely related to RNA polymerases in eukaryotes based on the subunit compositions. Archaeal RNAP is a large multi-protein complex, made up of 11 to 13 subunits, depending on the species, that are responsible for the synthesis of RNA. Structure studies suggest that RNAP complexes from different organisms share a crab-claw-shaped structure. The largest eukaryotic RNAP subunit is encoded by two separate archaeal subunits (A' and A'') which correspond to the N- and C-terminal domains of eukaryotic RNAP II Rpb1, respectively. The N-terminal domain of Rpb1 forms part of the active site and includes the head and the core of one clamp as well as the pore and funnel structures of RNAP II. Based on a structural comparison among the archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic RNAPs the DNA binding channel and the active site are part of A' subunit which is conserved. The strong similarity between subunit A' and the N-terminal domain of Rpb1 suggests a similar functional and structural role for these two proteins.</td>

Structure studies suggest that RNAP complexes from different organisms share a crab-claw-shape structure. In yeast, Rpb1 and Rpb2, each makes up one clamp, one jaw, and part of the cleft.

RNAP III is the largest nuclear RNA polymerase with 17 subunits. Structure studies suggest that different RNA polymerase complexes share a similar crab-claw-shaped structure. The N-terminal domain of Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNAP II in yeast, forms part of the active site, making up the head and core of the one clamp, as well as the pore and funnel structures of RNAP II.

RNAP I consists of at least 14 different subunits, the largest being homologous to subunit Rpb1 of yeast RNAP II and subunit beta' of bacterial RNAP. The yeast member of this family is known as Rpb190. Structure studies suggest that different RNA polymerase complexes share a similar crab-claw-shaped structure. The N-terminal domain of Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNAP II in yeast, forms part of the active site.

Higher plants have five multi-subunit nuclear RNA polymerases; RNAP I, RNAP II and RNAP III, which are essential for viability, plus the two isoforms of the non-essential polymerase RNAP IV and V, which specialize in small RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways. RNAP IV and/or V might be involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation of endogenous repetitive elements, silencing of transgenes, regulation of flowering-time genes, inducible regulation of adjacent gene pairs, and spreading of mobile silencing signals. The subunit compositions of RNAP IV and V reveal that they evolved from RNAP II.</td>
