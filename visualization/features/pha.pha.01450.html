            <td id=al>TIGR00004 reactive intermediate/imine deaminase. This protein was described initially as an inhibitor of protein synthesis intiation, then as an endoribonuclease active on single-stranded mRNA, endoribonuclease L-PSP. Members of this family, conserved in all domains of life and often with several members per bacterial genome, appear to catalyze a reaction that minimizes toxic by-products from reactions catalyzed by pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes.

            <td id=al>pfam01042 Endoribonuclease L-PSP. Endoribonuclease active on single-stranded mRNA. Inhibits protein synthesis by cleavage of mRNA. Previously thought to inhibit protein synthesis initiation. This protein may also be involved in the regulation of purine biosynthesis. YjgF (renamed RidA) family members are enamine/imine deaminases. They hydrolyze reactive intermediates released by PLP-dependent enzymes, including threonine dehydratase. YjgF also prevents inhibition of transaminase B (IlvE) in Salmonella.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00448 YjgF, YER057c, and UK114 belong to a large family of proteins present in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes with no definitive function. The conserved domain is similar in structure to chorismate mutase but there is no sequence similarity and no functional connection. Members of this family have been implicated in isoleucine (Yeo7, Ibm1, aldR) and purine (YjgF) biosynthesis, as well as threonine anaerobic degradation (tdcF) and mitochondrial DNA maintenance (Ibm1). This domain homotrimerizes forming a distinct intersubunit cavity that may serve as a small molecule binding site.</td>

This CD contains the first of these domains. The YjgF-YER057c-UK114 protein family is a large family of proteins present in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes with no definitive function.
