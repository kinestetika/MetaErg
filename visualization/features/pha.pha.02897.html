Succinoglycan Biosynthesis Protein ExoA catalyzes the formation of a beta-1,3 linkage of the second sugar (glucose) of the succinoglycan with the galactose on the lipid carrie. Succinoglycan is an acidic exopolysaccharide that is important for invasion of the nodules. Succinoglycan is a high-molecular-weight polymer composed of repeating octasaccharide units. These units are synthesized on membrane-bound isoprenoid lipid carriers, beginning with galactose followed by seven glucose molecules, and modified by the addition of acetate, succinate, and pyruvate. ExoA is a membrane protein with a transmembrance domain at c-terminus.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00761 Glycosyltransferase family A (GT-A) includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are enzymes that synthesize oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates by transferring the sugar moiety from an activated nucleotide-sugar donor to an acceptor molecule, which may be a growing oligosaccharide, a lipid, or a protein.  Based on the stereochemistry of the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins. But it also includes families GT-43, GT-6, GT-8, GT13 and GT-7; which are evolutionarily related to GT-2 and share structure similarities.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06423 CESA_like is  the cellulose synthase superfamily. The cellulose synthase (CESA) superfamily includes a wide variety of glycosyltransferase family 2 enzymes that share the common characteristic of catalyzing the elongation of polysaccharide chains. The members include cellulose synthase catalytic subunit, chitin synthase, glucan biosynthesis protein and other families of CESA-like proteins. Cellulose synthase catalyzes the polymerization reaction of cellulose, an aggregate of unbranched polymers of beta-1,4-linked glucose residues in  plants, most algae, some bacteria and fungi, and even some animals. In bacteria, algae and lower eukaryotes, there is a second unrelated type of cellulose synthase (Type II), which produces acylated cellulose, a derivative of cellulose. Chitin synthase catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from substrate UDP-GlcNAc into chitin, which is a linear homopolymer of beta-(1,4)-linked GlcNAc residues and Glucan Biosynthesis protein catalyzes the elongation of beta-1,2 polyglucose chains of Glucan.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03801 phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosyltransferase. This family is most closely related to the GT4 family of glycosyltransferases and named after PimA in Propionibacterium freudenreichii, which is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIM) which are early precursors in the biosynthesis of lipomannans (LM) and lipoarabinomannans (LAM), and catalyzes the addition of a mannosyl residue from GDP-D-mannose (GDP-Man) to the position 2 of the carrier lipid phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) to generate a phosphatidyl-myo-inositol bearing an alpha-1,2-linked mannose residue (PIM1). Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. The acceptor molecule can be a lipid, a protein, a heterocyclic compound, or another carbohydrate residue. This group of glycosyltransferases is most closely related to the previously defined glycosyltransferase family 1 (GT1). The members of this family may transfer UDP, ADP, GDP, or CMP linked sugars. The diverse enzymatic activities among members of this family reflect a wide range of biological functions. The protein structure available for this family has the GTB topology, one of the two protein topologies observed for nucleotide-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases. GTB proteins have distinct N- and C- terminal domains each containing a typical Rossmann fold. The two domains have high structural homology despite minimal sequence homology. The large cleft that separates the two domains includes the catalytic center and permits a high degree of flexibility. The members of this family are found mainly in certain bacteria and archaea.</td>

Cellulose is an aggregate of unbranched polymers of beta-1,4-linked glucose residues, which is an abundant polysaccharide produced by plants and in varying degrees by several other organisms including algae, bacteria, fungi, and even some animals. Genomes from higher plants harbor multiple CESA genes. There are ten in Arabidopsis. At least three different CESA proteins are required to form a functional complex. In Arabidopsis, CESA1, 3 and 6 and CESA4, 7 and 8, are required for cellulose biosynthesis during primary and secondary cell wall formation. CESA2 is very closely related to CESA6 and is viewed as a prime substitute for CESA6. They functionally compensate each other. The cesa2 and cesa6 double mutant plants were significantly smaller, while the single mutant plants were almost normal.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06434 Hyaluronan synthases catalyze polymerization of hyaluronan. Hyaluronan synthases (HASs) are bi-functional glycosyltransferases that catalyze polymerization of hyaluronan. HASs transfer both GlcUA and GlcNAc in beta-(1,3) and beta-(1,4) linkages, respectively to the hyaluronan chain using UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA as substrates. HA is made as a free glycan, not attached to a protein or lipid. HASs do not need a primer for HA synthesis; they initiate HA biosynthesis de novo with only UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcUA, and Mg2+. Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear heteropolysaccharide composed of (1-3)-linked beta-D-GlcUA-beta-D-GlcNAc disaccharide repeats. It can be found in vertebrates and a few microbes and is typically on the cell surface or in the extracellular space, but is also found inside mammalian cells. Hyaluronan has several physiochemical and biological functions such as space filling, lubrication, and providing a hydrated matrix through which cells can migrate.</td>

The periplasmic cyclic beta-(1,3),beta-(1,6)-D-glucans function for osmoregulation. The ndvC mutation also affects the ability of the bacteria to establish a successful symbiotic interaction with host plant.

Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. The acceptor molecule can be a lipid, a protein, a heterocyclic compound, or another carbohydrate residue. This group of glycosyltransferases is most closely related to the previously defined glycosyltransferase family 1 (GT1). The members of this family may transfer UDP, ADP, GDP, or CMP linked sugars. The diverse enzymatic activities among members of this family reflect a wide range of biological functions. The protein structure available for this family has the GTB topology, one of the two protein topologies observed for nucleotide-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases. GTB proteins have distinct N- and C- terminal domains each containing a typical Rossmann fold. The two domains have high structural homology despite minimal sequence homology. The large cleft that separates the two domains includes the catalytic center and permits a high degree of flexibility. The members of this family are found mainly in bacteria, while some of them are also found in Archaea and eukaryotes.</td>

DPM synthase is required for synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, N-glycan precursor, protein O-mannose, and C-mannose. In higher eukaryotes,the enzyme has three subunits, DPM1, DPM2 and DPM3. DPM is synthesized from dolichol phosphate and GDP-Man on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane by DPM synthase and then is flipped onto the luminal side and used as a donor substrate. In lower eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trypanosoma brucei, DPM synthase consists of a single component (Dpm1p and TbDpm1, respectively) that possesses one predicted transmembrane region near the C terminus for anchoring to the ER membrane. In contrast, the Dpm1 homologues of higher eukaryotes, namely fission yeast, fungi, and animals, have no transmembrane region, suggesting the existence of adapter molecules for membrane anchoring. This family also includes bacteria and archaea DPM1_like enzymes. However, the enzyme structure and mechanism of function are not well understood. The UDP-glucose:dolichyl-phosphate glucosyltransferase (DPG_synthase) is a transmembrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum involved in protein N-linked glycosylation. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to dolichyl phosphate. This protein family belongs to Glycosyltransferase 2 superfamily.</td>
