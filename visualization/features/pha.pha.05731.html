The class B metal beta-lactamases (MBLs) for which this fold was named perform only a small fraction of the activities included in this superfamily.Activities carried out by superfamily members include class B beta-lactamases, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases, AHL (acyl homoserine lactone) lactonases, persulfide dioxygenases, flavodiiron proteins, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors such as the Int9 and Int11 subunits of Integrator, Sdsa1-like and AtsA-like arylsulfatases, 5'-exonucleases human SNM1A and yeast Pso2p, ribonuclease J and ribonuclease Z, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, insecticide hydrolases, and proteins required for natural transformation competence. Classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, however the diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry. Some members of this subgroup are named as octanoyltransferase (also known as lipoate-protein ligase B).</td>
