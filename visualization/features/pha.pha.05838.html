            <td id=al>thymidylate synthase, methanogen type. Thymidylate synthase makes dTMP for DNA synthesis, and is among the most widely distributed of all enzymes. Members of this protein family are encoded within a completed genome sequence if and only if that species is one of the methanogenenic archaea. In these species, tetrahydromethanopterin replaces tetrahydrofolate, The member from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was shown to behave as a thymidylate synthase based on similar side reactions (the exchange of a characteristic proton with water), although the full reaction was not reconstituted. Partial sequence data showed no similarity to known thymidylate synthases simply because the region sequenced was from a distinctive N-terminal region not found in other thymidylate synthases. Members of this protein family appear, therefore, to a novel, tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent thymidylate synthase.

            <td id=al>Thymidylate synthase and pyrimidine hydroxymethylase: Thymidylate synthase (TS) and deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase (dCMP-HMase) are homologs that catalyze analogous alkylation of C5 of pyrimidine nucleotides. Both enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of DNA precursors and are active as homodimers. However, they exhibit distinct pyrimidine base specificities and differ in the details of their catalyzed reactions. TS is biologically ubiquitous and catalyzes the conversion of dUMP and methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) to dTMP and dihydrofolate (DHF). It also acts as a regulator of its own expression by binding and inactivating its own RNA. Due to its key role in the de novo pathway for thymidylate synthesis and, hence, DNA synthesis, it is one of the most conserved enzymes across species and phyla. TS is a well-recognized target for anticancer chemotherapy, as well as a valuable new target against infectious diseases. Interestingly, in several protozoa, a single polypeptide chain codes for both, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), forming a bifunctional enzyme (DHFR-TS), possibly through gene fusion at a single evolutionary point. DHFR-TS is also active as a dimer. Virus encoded dCMP-HMase catalyzes the reversible conversion of dCMP and CH2THF to hydroxymethyl-dCMP and THF. This family also includes dUMP hydroxymethylase, which is encoded by several bacteriophages that infect Bacillus subtilis, for their own protection against the host restriction system,  and contain hydroxymethyl-dUMP instead of dTMP in their DNA.</td>

            <td id=al>Domain of unknown function (DUF4346). This family of proteins is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Proteins in this family are typically between 127 and 502 amino acids in length. There are two conserved sequence motifs: LDP and DHA. Many members of this family have been annotated as dihydropteroate synthases, however no experimental evidence can be found for this and MJ0107 has been shown not to possess dihydropteroate synthase activity.</td>

            <td id=al>dihydropteroate synthase-related protein. This protein has been found so far only in the Archaea, and in particular in those archaea that lack a bacterial-type dihydropteroate synthase. The central region of this protein shows considerable homology to the amino-terminal half of dihydropteroate synthases, while the carboxyl-terminal region shows homology to the small, uncharacterized protein slr0651 of Synechocystis PCC6803.
