            <td id=al>cd06112 Citrate synthase (CS) catalyzes the condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and oxalacetate (OAA) to form citrate and coenzyme A (CoA), the first step in the oxidative citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle). Peroxisomal CS is involved in the glyoxylate cycle. This group also includes CS proteins which functions as a 2-methylcitrate synthase (2MCS). 2MCS catalyzes the condensation of propionyl-CoA (PrCoA) and OAA to form 2-methylcitrate and CoA during propionate metabolism. This group contains proteins which functions exclusively as either a CS or a 2MCS, as well as those with relaxed specificity which have dual functions as both a CS and a 2MCS. The overall CS reaction is thought to proceed through three partial reactions and involves both closed and open conformational forms of the enzyme: a) the carbanion or equivalent is generated from AcCoA by base abstraction of a proton, b) the nucleophilic attack of this carbanion on OAA to generate citryl-CoA, and c) the hydrolysis of citryl-CoA to produce citrate and CoA. There are two types of CSs: type I CS and type II CSs.  Type I CSs are found in eukarya, gram-positive bacteria, archaea, and in some gram-negative bacteria and are homodimers with both subunits participating in the active site.  Type II CSs are unique to gram-negative bacteria and are homohexamers of identical subunits (approximated as a trimer of dimers).  Some type II CSs are strongly and specifically inhibited by NADH through an allosteric mechanism.</td>

CS catalyzes the condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and oxalacetate (OAA) to form citrate and coenzyme A (CoA), the first step in the citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle). 2MCS catalyzes the condensation of propionyl-coenzyme A (PrCoA) and OAA to form 2-methylcitrate and CoA during propionate metabolism.

This group contains proteins similar to BsCS-II, the major CS of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. A mutation in the gene which encodes BsCS-II (citZ gene) has been described which resulted in a significant loss of CS activity, partial glutamate auxotrophy, and a sporulation deficiency, all of which are characteristic of strains defective in the Krebs cycle. Streptococcus mutans CS, found in this group, may participate in a pathway for the anaerobic biosynthesis of glutamate. This group also contains functionally uncharacterized CSs of various gram-negative bacteria. Some of the gram-negative species represented in this group have a second CS isozyme found in another group. This group contains proteins which functions exclusively as either a CS or a 2MCS, as well as those with relaxed specificity which have dual functions as both a CS and a 2MCS.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR01800 2-methylcitrate synthase/citrate synthase II. Members of this family are dimeric enzymes with activity as 2-methylcitrate synthase, citrate synthase, or both. Many Gram-negative species have a hexameric citrate synthase, termed citrate synthase I (TIGR01798). Members of this family (TIGR01800) appear as a second citrate synthase isozyme but typically are associated with propionate metabolism and synthesize 2-methylcitrate from propionyl-CoA; citrate synthase activity may be incidental. A number of species, including Thermoplasma acidophilum, Pyrococcus furiosus, and the Antarctic bacterium DS2-3R have a bifunctional member of this family as the only citrate synthase isozyme.</td>

This group contains three Arabidopsis peroxisomal CS proteins, CYS1, -2, and -3 which are involved in the glyoxylate cycle. AthCYS1, in addition to a peroxisomal targeting sequence, has a predicted secretory signal peptide; it may be targeted to both the secretory pathway and the peroxisomes and is thought to be located in the extracellular matrix. AthCSY1 is expressed only in siliques and specifically in developing seeds. AthCSY2 and 3 are active during seed germination and seedling development and are thought to participate in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids.</td>

Citrate synthase (CS) catalyzes the condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and OAA to form citrate and coenzyme A (CoA), the first step in the citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle). This group contains proteins similar to the E. coli 2MCS, EcPrpC.  EcPrpC is one of two CS isozymes in the gram-negative E. coli. EcPrpC is a dimeric (type I ) CS; it is induced during growth on propionate and prefers PrCoA as a substrate though it has partial CS activity with AcCoA. This group also includes Salmonella typhimurium PrpC and Ralstonia eutropha (Re) 2-MCS1 which are also induced during growth on propionate and prefer PrCoA as substrate, but can also use AcCoA. Re 2-MCS1 can use butyryl-CoA and valeryl-CoA at a lower rate. A second Ralstonia eutropha 2MCS, Re 2-MCS2, which is induced on propionate is also found in this group. This group may include proteins which may function exclusively as a CS, those which may function exclusively as a 2MCS, or those with dual specificity which functions as both a CS and a 2MCS.</td>

CS catalyzes the condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and oxalacetate (OAA) to form citrate and coenzyme A (CoA), the first step in the citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle). 2-methylcitrate synthase (2MCS) catalyzes the condensation of propionyl-coenzyme A (PrCoA) and OAA to form 2-methylcitrate and coenzyme A (CoA) during propionate metabolism. The overall CS reaction is thought to proceed through three partial reactions: a) the carbanion or equivalent is generated from AcCoA by base abstraction of a proton, b) the nucleophilic attack of this carbanion on OAA to generate citryl-CoA, and c) the hydrolysis of citryl-CoA to produce citrate and CoA. DsCS, compared with CS from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus (not included in this group), has an increase in the size of surface loops, a higher proline content in the loop regions, a more accessible active site, and a higher number of intramolecular ion pairs. This group contains proteins which functions exclusively as either a CS or a 2MCS, as well as those with relaxed specificity which have dual functions as both a CS and a 2MCS. For example, included in this group are Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cg) PrpC1 and -2, which are only synthesized during growth on propionate-containing medium, can use PrCoA, AcCoA and butyryl-CoA as substrates, and have comparable catalytic activity with AcCoA as the major CgCS (GltA, not included in this group).</td>

This group also includes CS proteins which functions as a 2-methylcitrate synthase (2MCS). 2MCS catalyzes the condensation of propionyl-CoA (PrCoA) and OAA to form 2-methylcitrate and CoA during propionate metabolism. This group contains proteins which functions exclusively as either a CS or a 2MCS, as well as those with relaxed specificity which have dual functions as both a CS and a 2MCS. The overall CS reaction is thought to proceed through three partial reactions and involves both closed and open conformational forms of the enzyme: a) the carbanion or equivalent is generated from AcCoA by base abstraction of a proton, b) the nucleophilic attack of this carbanion on OAA to generate citryl-CoA, and c) the hydrolysis of citryl-CoA to produce citrate and CoA. There are two types of CSs: type I CS and type II CSs. Type I CSs are found in eukarya, gram-positive bacteria, archaea, and in some gram-negative bacteria and form homodimers with both subunits participating in the active site. Type II CSs are unique to gram-negative bacteria and are homohexamers of identical subunits (approximated as a trimer of dimers).  Some type II CSs are strongly and specifically inhibited by NADH through an allosteric mechanism. This subgroup includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.</td>

CS catalyzes the condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and oxalacetate (OAA) to form citrate and coenzyme A (CoA), the first step in the citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle). 2MCS catalyzes the condensation of propionyl-coenzyme A (PrCoA) and OAA to form 2-methylcitrate and coenzyme A (CoA) during propionate metabolism. The overall CS reaction is thought to proceed through three partial reactions and involves both closed and open conformational forms of the enzyme: a) the carbanion or equivalent is generated from AcCoA by base abstraction of a proton, b) the nucleophilic attack of this carbanion on OAA to generate citryl-CoA, and c) the hydrolysis of citryl-CoA to produce citrate and CoA. This group contains proteins similar to BsCS-I, one of two CS isozymes in the gram-positive B. subtilis. The majority of CS activity in B. subtilis is provided by the other isozyme, BsCS-II (not included in this group). BsCS-I has a lower catalytic activity than BsCS-II, and has a Glu in place of a key catalytic Asp residue. This change is conserved in other members of this group. For E. coli CS (not included in this group), site directed mutagenesis of the key Asp residue to a Glu converts the enzyme into citryl-CoA lyase which cleaves citryl-CoA to AcCoA and OAA.  A null mutation in the gene encoding BsCS-I (citA) had little effect on B. subtilis CS activity or on sporulation. However, disruption of the citA gene in a strain null for the gene encoding BsCS-II resulted in a sporulation deficiency, a characteristic of strains defective in the Krebs cycle. This group contains proteins which functions exclusively as either a CS or a 2MCS, as well as those with relaxed specificity which have dual functions as both a CS and a 2MCS. Many of the gram-negative species represented in this group have a second CS isozyme which is in another group.</td>

CS catalyzes the condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and oxalacetate (OAA) from citrate and coenzyme A (CoA), the first step in the oxidative citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle). Peroxisomal CS is involved in the glyoxylate cycle. Some CS proteins function as a 2-methylcitrate synthase (2MCS). 2MCS catalyzes the condensation of propionyl-CoA (PrCoA) and OAA to form 2-methylcitrate and CoA during propionate metabolism. CCL cleaves citryl-CoA (CiCoA) to AcCoA and OAA. ACLs catalyze an ATP- and a CoA- dependant cleavage of citrate to form AcCoA and OAA; they do this in a multistep reaction, the final step of which is likely to involve the cleavage of CiCoA to generate AcCoA and OAA. The overall CS reaction is thought to proceed through three partial reactions and involves both closed and open conformational forms of the enzyme: a) the carbanion or equivalent is generated from AcCoA by base abstraction of a proton, b) the nucleophilic attack of this carbanion on OAA to generate CiCoA, and c) the hydrolysis of CiCoA to produce citrate and CoA.

Some type II CSs are strongly and specifically inhibited by NADH through an allosteric mechanism.  In fungi, yeast, plants, and animals ACL is cytosolic and generates AcCoA for lipogenesis. In several groups of autotrophic prokaryotes and archaea, ACL carries out the citrate-cleavage reaction of the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. In the family Aquificaceae this latter reaction in the rTCA cycle is carried out via a two enzyme system the second enzyme of which is CCL.</td>

Type II CSs are unique to gram-negative bacteria and are homohexamers of identical subunits (approximated as a trimer of dimers).  This group includes three S. cerevisiae CS proteins, ScCit1,-2,-3. ScCit1 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial CS with highly specificity for AcCoA; in addition to having activity with AcCoA, it plays a part in the construction of the TCA cycle metabolon. Yeast cells deleted for Cit1 are hyper-susceptible to apoptosis induced by heat and aging stress. ScCit2 is a peroxisomal CS involved in the glyoxylate cycle; in addition to having activity with AcCoA, it may have activity with PrCoA. ScCit3 is a mitochondrial CS and functions in the metabolism of PrCoA; it is a dual specificity CS and 2MCS, having similar catalytic efficiency with both AcCoA and PrCoA. The pattern of expression of the ScCIT3 gene follows that of the ScCIT1 gene and its expression is increased in the presence of a ScCIT1 deletion. Included in this group is the Tetrahymena 14 nm filament protein which functions as a CS in mitochondria and as a cytoskeletal component in cytoplasm and Geobacter sulfurreducens (GSu) CS. GSuCS is dimeric and eukaryotic-like; it lacks 2MCS activity and  is inhibited by ATP. In contrast to eukaryotic and other prokaryotic CSs, GSuCIT is not stimulated by K+ ions.

ACL catalyzes an ATP- and a CoA- dependant cleavage of citrate to form AcCoA and OAA in a multistep reaction, the final step of which is likely to involve the cleavage of CiCoA to generate AcCoA and OAA. In fungi, yeast, plants, and animals ACL is cytosolic and generates AcCoA for lipogenesis. ACL may be required for fruiting body maturation in the filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospore. In several groups of autotrophic prokaryotes and archaea, ACL carries out the citrate-cleavage reaction of the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. In the family Aquificaceae this latter reaction in the rTCA cycle is carried out via a two enzyme system the second enzyme of which is CCL; the first enzyme is citryl-CoA synthetase (CCS) which is not included in this group. Chlorobium limicola ACL is an example of a two-subunit type ACL. It is comprised of a large and a small subunit; it has been speculated that the large subunit arose from a fusion of the small subunit of the two subunit CCS with CCL. The small ACL subunit is a homolog of the larger CCS subunit. Mammalian ACL is of the single-subunit type and may have arisen from the two-subunit ACL by another gene fusion. Mammalian ACLs are homotetramers; the ACLs of C. limicola and Arabidopsis are a heterooctomers (alpha4beta4). In cancer cells there is a shift in energy metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, the glycolytic end product pyruvate enters a truncated TCA cycle generating citrate which is cleaved in the cytosol by ACL. Inhibiting ACL limits the in-vitro proliferation and survival of these cancer cells, reduces in vivo tumor growth, and induces differentiation.</td>
