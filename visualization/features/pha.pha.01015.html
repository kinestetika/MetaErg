Aconitate hydratase B catalyses the formation of cis-aconitate from citrate as part of the TCA cycle. Aconitase has an active (4FE-4S) and an inactive (3FE-4S) form. The active cluster is part of the catalytic site that interconverts citrate, cis-aconitase and isocitrate. The domain architecture of aconitase B is different from other aconitases in that the catalytic domain is normally found at C-terminus for other aconitases, but it is at N-terminus for B family. It also has a HEAT domain before domain 4 which plays a role in protein-protein interaction. This alignment is the core domain including domains 1,2 and 3.</td>

            <td id=al>Aconitase catalytic domain; Aconitase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate and isocitrate as part of the TCA cycle. Aconitase catalytic domain. Aconitase (aconitate hydratase) catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate and isocitrate as part of the TCA cycle.  Cis-aconitate is formed as an intermediate product during the course of the reaction. In eukaryotes two isozymes of aconitase are known to exist: one found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other found in the cytoplasm. Aconitase, in its active form, contains a 4Fe-4S  iron-sulfur cluster; three cysteine residues have been shown to be ligands of the 4Fe-4S cluster. This is the Aconitase core domain, including structural domains 1, 2 and 3, which binds the Fe-S cluster. The aconitase family also contains the following proteins: - Iron-responsive  element binding protein (IRE-BP), a cytosolic protein that binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs). IREs are stem-loop structures found in  the 5'UTR of ferritin, and delta aminolevulinic acid synthase mRNAs, and in the 3'UTR of  transferrin receptor mRNA. IRE-BP also express aconitase activity. - 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (isopropylmalate isomerase), the enzyme that catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of leucine. - Homoaconitase (homoaconitate hydratase), an enzyme that participates in the  alpha-aminoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis and that converts cis-homoaconitate into homoisocitric acid.</td>

This subfamily includes the members of TIGR01343 which are gene clustered with other genes of leucine biosynthesis. The rest of the subfamily includes mainly archaeal species which exhibit two hits to this model. In these cases it is possible that one or the other of the hits does not have a 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase activity but rather one of the other related aconitase-like activities.</td>

Because this model is based on just two sequences from a narrow taxonomic range, it may not recognize distant orthologs, should any exist. Homoaconitase, aconitase, and 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase have similar overall structures, but 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase is split into large (leuC) and small (leuD) chains in eubacteria. Several pairs of archaeal proteins resemble leuC and leuD over their lengths but are even closer to the respective domains of homoaconitase, and their identity is uncertain.
