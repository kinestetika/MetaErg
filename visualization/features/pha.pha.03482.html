            <td id=al>cd00761 Glycosyltransferase family A (GT-A) includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are enzymes that synthesize oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates by transferring the sugar moiety from an activated nucleotide-sugar donor to an acceptor molecule, which may be a growing oligosaccharide, a lipid, or a protein.  Based on the stereochemistry of the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins. But it also includes families GT-43, GT-6, GT-8, GT13 and GT-7; which are evolutionarily related to GT-2 and share structure similarities.</td>

The cellulose synthase (CESA) superfamily includes a wide variety of glycosyltransferase family 2 enzymes that share the common characteristic of catalyzing the elongation of polysaccharide chains. The members include cellulose synthase catalytic subunit, chitin synthase, glucan biosynthesis protein and other families of CESA-like proteins. Cellulose synthase catalyzes the polymerization reaction of cellulose, an aggregate of unbranched polymers of beta-1,4-linked glucose residues in  plants, most algae, some bacteria and fungi, and even some animals. In bacteria, algae and lower eukaryotes, there is a second unrelated type of cellulose synthase (Type II), which produces acylated cellulose, a derivative of cellulose. Chitin synthase catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from substrate UDP-GlcNAc into chitin, which is a linear homopolymer of beta-(1,4)-linked GlcNAc residues and Glucan Biosynthesis protein catalyzes the elongation of beta-1,2 polyglucose chains of Glucan.</td>

Succinoglycan Biosynthesis Protein ExoA catalyzes the formation of a beta-1,3 linkage of the second sugar (glucose) of the succinoglycan with the galactose on the lipid carrie. Succinoglycan is an acidic exopolysaccharide that is important for invasion of the nodules. Succinoglycan is a high-molecular-weight polymer composed of repeating octasaccharide units. These units are synthesized on membrane-bound isoprenoid lipid carriers, beginning with galactose followed by seven glucose molecules, and modified by the addition of acetate, succinate, and pyruvate. ExoA is a membrane protein with a transmembrance domain at c-terminus.</td>

NdvC_like  proteins in this family are putative bacterial beta-(1,6)-glucosyltransferase. Bradyrhizobium japonicum synthesizes periplasmic cyclic beta-(1,3),beta-(1,6)-D-glucans during growth under hypoosmotic conditions. Two genes (ndvB, ndvC) are involved in the beta-(1, 3), beta-(1,6)-glucan synthesis. The ndvC mutant strain resulted in synthesis of altered cyclic beta-glucans composed almost entirely of beta-(1, 3)-glycosyl linkages. The periplasmic cyclic beta-(1,3),beta-(1,6)-D-glucans function for osmoregulation. The ndvC mutation also affects the ability of the bacteria to establish a successful symbiotic interaction with host plant. Thus, the beta-glucans may function as suppressors of a host defense response.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06434 Hyaluronan synthases catalyze polymerization of hyaluronan. Hyaluronan synthases (HASs) are bi-functional glycosyltransferases that catalyze polymerization of hyaluronan. HASs transfer both GlcUA and GlcNAc in beta-(1,3) and beta-(1,4) linkages, respectively to the hyaluronan chain using UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA as substrates. HA is made as a free glycan, not attached to a protein or lipid. HASs do not need a primer for HA synthesis; they initiate HA biosynthesis de novo with only UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcUA, and Mg2+. Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear heteropolysaccharide composed of (1-3)-linked beta-D-GlcUA-beta-D-GlcNAc disaccharide repeats. It can be found in vertebrates and a few microbes and is typically on the cell surface or in the extracellular space, but is also found inside mammalian cells. Hyaluronan has several physiochemical and biological functions such as space filling, lubrication, and providing a hydrated matrix through which cells can migrate.</td>
