This subfamily also includes proteins characterized as pyruvate NADP+ oxidoreductase (PNO). These enzymes are dependent on TPP and a divalent metal cation as cofactors. PFOR and PNO catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, a crucial step in many metabolic pathways. Archaea, anaerobic bacteria and eukaryotes that lack mitochondria (and therefore pyruvate dehydrogenase) use PFOR to oxidatively decarboxylate pyruvate, with ferredoxin or flavodoxin as the electron acceptor. The PFOR from cyanobacterium Anabaena (NifJ) is required for the transfer of electrons from pyruvate to flavodoxin, which reduces nitrogenase. The facultative anaerobic mitochondrion of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis oxidizes pyruvate with PNO.</td>

Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP family), pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain, of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (IOR) alpha subunit (IOR-alpha), and related proteins, subfamily. The PYR domain is found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. However, for the homodimeric enzyme Desulfovibrio africanus pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), each active site lies at the interface of the PYR and PP domains from the same subunit. This subfamily includes proteins characterized as pyruvate NADP+ oxidoreductase (PNO). PFOR and PNO catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, a crucial step in many metabolic pathways. The facultative anaerobic mitochondrion of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis oxidizes pyruvate with PNO. IOR catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of arylpyruvates, such as indolepyruvate or phenylpyruvate.</td>

It is not known whether the gamma subunit has a catalytic or regulatory role. Pyruvate oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the final step in the fermentation of carbohydrates in anaerobic microorganisms. This involves the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate with the participation of thiamine followed by the transfer of an acetyl moiety to coenzyme A for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. The family also includes pyruvate flavodoxin oxidoreductase as encoded by the nifJ gene in cyanobacterium which is required for growth on molecular nitrogen when iron is limited.</td>

TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue.

The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this group. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. In the case of 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase (2OXO), sulfopyruvate decarboxylase (ComDE), and the E1 component of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (E1- PDHc) the PYR and PP domains appear on different subunits. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. However, for the homodimeric enzymes 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and Desulfovibrio africanus pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), each active site lies at the interface of the PYR and PP domains from the same subunit.</td>

            <td id=al>cd10549 Uncharacterized polyferredoxin-like protein. This family contains uncharacterized polyferredoxin protein similar to Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum MvhB. The mvhB is a gene of the methylviologen-reducing hydrogenase operon. It is predicted to contain 12 [4Fe-4S] clusters, and was therefore suggested to be a polyferredoxin. As a subfamily of the beta subunit of the DMSO Reductase (DMSOR) family, it is predicted to function as electron carrier in the reducing reaction.</td>
