            <td id=al>type I secretion membrane fusion protein, HlyD family. Type I secretion is an ABC transport process that exports proteins, without cleavage of any signal sequence, from the cytosol to extracellular medium across both inner and outer membranes. The secretion signal is found in the C-terminus of the transported protein. This model represents the adaptor protein between the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein of the inner membrane and the outer membrane protein, and is called the membrane fusion protein. This model selects a subfamily closely related to HlyD; it is defined narrowly and excludes, for example, colicin V secretion protein CvaA and multidrug efflux proteins.

            <td id=al>HlyD membrane-fusion protein of T1SS. HlyD is a component of the prototypical alpha-haemolysin (HlyA) bacterial type I secretion system, along with the other components HlyB and TolC. HlyD and HlyB are inner-membrane proteins and specific components of the transport apparatus of alpha-haemolysin. HlyD is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by a single transmembrane domain and has a large periplasmic domain within the carboxy-terminal 100 amino acids, HlyB and HlyD form a stable complex that binds the recombinant protein bearing a C-terminal HlyA signal sequence and ATP in the cytoplasm. HlyD, HlyB and TolC combine to form the three-component ABC transporter complex that forms a trans-membrane channel or pore through which HlyA can be transferred directly to the extracellular medium. Cutinase has been shown to be transported effectively through this pore.</td>

            <td id=al>RND family efflux transporter, MFP subunit. This model represents the MFP (membrane fusion protein) component of the RND family of transporters. RND refers to Resistance, Nodulation, and cell Division. It is, in part, a subfamily of pfam00529 (Pfam release 7.5) but hits substantial numbers of proteins missed by that model. The related HlyD secretion protein, for which pfam00529 is named, is outside the scope of this model. Attributed functions imply outward transport. These functions include nodulation, acriflavin resistance, heavy metal efflux, and multidrug resistance proteins. Most members of this family are found in Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed function of MFP proteins is to bring the inner and outer membranes together and enable transport to the outside of the outer membrane. Note, however, that a few members of this family are found in Gram-positive bacteria, where there is no outer membrane. [Transport and binding proteins, Unknown substrate]</td>

This family represents the SMC protein of archaea and a few bacteria (Aquifex, Synechocystis, etc); the SMC of other bacteria is described by TIGR02168.
