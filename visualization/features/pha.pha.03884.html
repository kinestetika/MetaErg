            <td id=al>Escherichia coli glycerol kinase-like proteins; belongs to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. This subgroup is composed of mostly bacterial and archaeal glycerol kinases (GK), including the well characterized proteins from Escherichia coli (EcGK), Thermococcus kodakaraensis (TkGK), and Enterococcus casseliflavus (EnGK). GKs contain two large domains separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. The high affinity ATP binding site of EcGK is created only by a substrate-induced conformational change, which is initiated by protein-protein interactions through complex formation with enzyme IIAGlc (also known as IIIGlc), the glucose-specific phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system (PTS). EcGK exists in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium. IIAGlc binds to both EcGK dimer and tetramer, and inhibits the uptake and subsequent metabolism of glycerol and maltose. Another well-known allosteric regulator of EcGK is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which binds to the EcGK tetramer and plays an essential role in the stabilization of the inactive tetrameric form. EcGK requires Mg2+ for its enzymatic activity. Members in this subgroup belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases</td>

            <td id=al>Glycerol kinases; a subfamily of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. This subfamily includes glycerol kinases (GK; EC 2.7.1.30) and glycerol kinase-like proteins from all three kingdoms of living organisms. Glycerol is an important intermediate of energy metabolism and it plays fundamental roles in several vital physiological processes. GKs are involved in the entry of external glycerol into cellular metabolism. They catalyze the rate-limiting step in glycerol metabolism by transferring a phosphate from ATP to glycerol thus producing glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) in the cytoplasm. Human GK deficiency, called hyperglycerolemia, is an X-linked recessive trait associated with psychomotor retardation, osteoporosis, spasticity, esotropia, and bone fractures. Under different conditions, GKs from different species may exist in different oligomeric states. The monomer of GKs is composed of two large domains separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. The high affinity ATP binding site of GKs is created only by a substrate-induced conformational change. Based on sequence similarity, some GK-like proteins from metazoa, which have lost their GK enzymatic activity, are also included in this CD. Members in this subfamily belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases.</td>

            <td id=al>Metazoan glycerol kinase 1 and 3-like proteins; belongs to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. This subgroup corresponds to a group of metazoan glycerol kinases (GKs), coded by X chromosome-linked GK genes, and glycerol kinase (GK)-like proteins, coded by autosomal testis-specific GK-like genes (GK-like genes, GK1 and GK3).  Sequence comparison shows that metazoan GKs and GK-like proteins in this family are closely related to the bacterial GKs, which catalyze the Mg-ATP dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to yield glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). The metazoan GKs do have GK enzymatic activity. However, the GK-like metazoan proteins do not exhibit GK activity and their biological functions are not yet clear. Some of them lack important functional residues involved in the binding of ADP and Mg2+, which may result in the loss of GK catalytic function. Others that have conserved catalytic residues have lost their GK activity as well; the reason remains unclear. It has been suggested the conserved catalytic residues might facilitate them performing a distinct function. GKs belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain.</td>

This subgroup corresponds to a small group of fungal glycerol kinases (GK), including Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gut1p/YHL032Cp, which phosphorylates glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate in the cytosol. Glycerol utilization has been considered as the sole source of carbon and energy in S. cerevisiae, and is mediated by glycerol kinase and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is encoded by the GUT2 gene. Members in this family show high similarity to their prokaryotic and eukaryotic homologs. GKs belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain.</td>

Sequence comparison shows members in this CD are homologs of Escherichia coli GK. They retain all functionally important residues, and may catalyze the Mg-ATP dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to yield glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). GKs belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site.

This subgroup includes Arabidopsis NHO1 (also known as NONHOST1, or noh-host resistant 1) and other putative plant glycerol kinases, which share strong homology with glycerol kinases from bacteria, fungi, and animals. Nonhost resistance of plants refers to the phenomenon observed when all members of a plant species are typically resistant to a specific parasite. NHO1 is required for nonspecific resistance to nonhost Pseudomonas bacteria, it is also required for resistance to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. This subgroup belongs to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain.</td>

This subgroup corresponds to a small group of proteobacterial glycerol kinase (GK)-like proteins, including the glycerol kinase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, take up glycerol passively by facilitated diffusion. In contrast, P. aeruginosa may also utilize a binding protein-dependent active transport system to mediate glycerol transportation. The glycerol kinase subsequently phosphorylates the intracellular glycerol to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). GKs belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain.</td>

This family is predominantly composed of glycerol kinase (GK) and similar carbohydrate kinases including rhamnulokinase (RhuK), xylulokinase (XK), gluconokinase (GntK), ribulokinase (RBK), and fuculokinase (FK). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group, usually from ATP, to their carbohydrate substrates. The monomer of FGGY proteins contains two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. One domain is primarily involved in sugar substrate binding, and the other is mainly responsible for ATP binding. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. Substrate-induced conformational changes and a divalent cation may be required for the catalytic activity.</td>

This subfamily is predominantly composed of bacterial D-xylulose kinases (XK, also known as xylulokinase; EC 2.7.1.17), which catalyze the rate-limiting step in the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of D-xylulose to produce D-xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) and ADP. Some uncharacterized sequences are also included in this subfamily. The prototypical member of this subfamily is Escherichia coli xylulokinase (EcXK), which exists as a dimer. Each monomer consists of two large domains separated by an open cleft that forms an active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. XKs do not have any known allosteric regulators, and they may have weak but significant activity in the absence of substrate. The presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ is required for catalytic activity. Members of this subfamily belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases.</td>

            <td id=al>Gluconate kinases; a subfamily of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. This subfamily is composed of a group of gluconate kinases (GntK, also known as gluconokinase; EC 2.7.1.12) encoded by the gntK gene, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of D-gluconate and produce 6-phospho-D-gluconate and ADP. The presence of Mg2+ might be required for catalytic activity. The prototypical member of this subfamily is GntK from Lactobacillus acidophilus. Unlike Escherichia coli GntK, which belongs to the superfamily of P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases, members in this subfamily are homologous to glycerol kinase, xylulose kinase, and rhamnulokinase from Escherichia coli. They have been classified as members of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, which contain two large domains separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model spans both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. Some uncharacterized homologous sequences are also included in this subfamily. The Lactobacillus gnt operon contains a single gntK gene. The gnt operons of some bacteria, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, have two gntK genes. For example, the C. glutamicum gnt operon has both a gluconate kinase gntV gene (also known as gntK) and a second hypothetical gntK gene (also known as gntK2). Both gluconate kinases encoded by these genes belong to this family, however the protein encoded by C. glutamicum gntV is not included in this model as it is truncated in the C-terminal domain.</td>
