            <td id=al>The substrate-binding component of an uncharacterized ABC-type nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide-like import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This CD represents the substrate-binding domain of an uncharacterized ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide-like transporter. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA and the dipeptide-binding protein DppA show significant sequence similarity to NikA, the initial nickel receptor. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis. Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators,  and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.</td>

This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways.

Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins.

This family represents the substrate-binding domain of the oligopeptide-binding protein, AppA, from Bacillus subtilis and its closest homologs from other bacteria and archaea. Bacillus subtilis has three ABC-type peptide transport systems, a dipeptide-binding protein (DppA) and two oligopeptide-binding proteins (OppA and AppA) with overlapping specificity. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and also is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.

This family includes the substrate-binding domain of an ABC-type oligopeptide-binding protein Hb8 from Thermus thermophilius and its closest homologs from other bacteria. The structural topology of this substrate-binding domain is similar to those of DppA from Escherichia coli and OppA from Salmonella typhimurium, and thus belongs to the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein (PBP2) superfamily. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis. The type 2 periplasmic binding proteins are soluble ligand-binding components of ABC or tripartite ATP-independent transporters and chemotaxis systems. Members of the PBP2 superfamily function in uptake of a variety of metabolites in bacteria such as amino acids, carbohydrate, ions, and polyamines. Ligands are then transported across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis or electrochemical ion gradient. Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.</td>

This CD represents the substrate-binding domain of an uncharacterized ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide-like transporter. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA and the dipeptide-binding protein DppA show significant sequence similarity to NikA, the initial nickel receptor. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis. Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators,  and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.</td>

            <td id=al>The substrate-binding domain of an oligopeptide binding protein (OppA2) from the biosynthesis pathway of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. Clavulanic acid (CA), a clinically important beta-lactamase inhibitor, is one of a family of clavams produced as secondary metabolites by fermentation of Streptomyces clavuligeru. The biosynthesis of CA proceeds via multiple steps from the precursors, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and arginine. CA possesses a characteristic (3R,5R) stereochemistry essential for reaction with penicillin-binding proteins and beta-lactamases. Two genes (oppA1 and oppA2) in the clavulanic acid gene cluster encode oligopeptide-binding proteins that are required for CA biosynthesis. OppA1/2 is involved in the binding and transport of peptides across the cell membrane of Streptomyces clavuligerus.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.

            <td id=al>The substrate-binding domain of mycobacterial lipoprotein Lpqw contains type 2 periplasmic binding fold. LpqW is one of key players in synthesis and transport of the unique components of the mycobacterial cell wall which is a complex structure rich in two related lipoglycans, the phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) and lipoarabinomannans (LAMs).  Lpqw is a highly conserved lipoprotein that transport intermediates from a pathway for mature PIMs production into a pathway for LAMs biosynthesis, thus controlling the relative abundance of these two essential components of cell wall.   LpqW is thought to have been adapted by the cell-wall biosynthesis machinery of mycobacteria and other closely related pathogens, evolving to play an important role in PIMs/LAMs biosynthesis.  Most of periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the LpqW protein. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.

            <td id=al>The C-terminal solute-binding domain of DNA-binding transcriptional regulator SgrR is related to the ABC-type oligopeptide-binding proteins and contains the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold. A novel family of SgrR transcriptional regulator contains a two-domain structure with an N terminal DNA-binding domain of the winged helix family and a C-terminal solute-binding domain. The C-terminal domain shows strong homology with the ABC-type oligopeptide-binding protein family, a member of the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold protein (PBP2) superfamily that also includes the C-terminal substrate-binding domain of LysR-type transcriptional regulators. SgrR (SugaR transport-related Regulator) is negatively autoregulated and activates transcription of divergent operon SgrS, which encodes a small RNA required for recovery from glucose-phosphate stress.  Hence, the small RNA SgrS and SgrR, the transcription factor that controls sgrS expression, are both required for recovery from glucose-phosphate stress.
