            <td id=al>Ribosomal protein L10 family, L10 subfamily; composed of bacterial 50S ribosomal protein and eukaryotic mitochondrial 39S ribosomal protein, L10. L10 occupies the L7/L12 stalk of the ribosome. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of L10 interacts with L11 protein and forms the base of the L7/L12 stalk, while the extended C-terminal helix binds to two or three dimers of the NTD of L7/L12 (L7 and L12 are identical except for an acetylated N-terminus). The L7/L12 stalk is known to contain the binding site for elongation factors G and Tu (EF-G and EF-Tu, respectively); however, there is disagreement as to whether or not L10 is involved in forming the binding site. The stalk is believed to be associated with GTPase activities in protein synthesis. In a neuroblastoma cell line, L10 has been shown to interact with the SH3 domain of Src and to activate the binding of the Nck1 adaptor protein with skeletal proteins such as the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) and the WASP-interacting protein (WIP). These bacteria and eukaryotic sequences have no additional C-terminal domain, present in other eukaryotic and archaeal orthologs.</td>

            <td id=al>Ribosomal protein L10 family; composed of the large subunit ribosomal protein called L10 in bacteria, P0 in eukaryotes, and L10e in archaea, as well as uncharacterized P0-like eukaryotic proteins. In all three kingdoms, L10 forms a tight complex with multiple copies of the small acidic protein L12(e). This complex forms a stalk structure on the large subunit of the ribosome. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of L10 interacts with L11 protein and forms the base of the L7/L12 stalk, while the extended C-terminal helix binds to two or three dimers of the NTD of L7/L12 (L7 and L12 are identical except for an acetylated N-terminus).

Some eukaryotic P0 sequences have an additional C-terminal domain homologous with acidic proteins P1 and P2.</td>
