            <td id=al>cd00880 E. coli Ras-like protein (Era)-like GTPase. The Era (E. coli Ras-like protein)-like family includes several distinct subfamilies (TrmE/ThdF, FeoB, YihA (EngB), Era, and EngA/YfgK) that generally show sequence conservation in the region between the Walker A and B motifs (G1 and G3 box motifs), to the exclusion of other GTPases. TrmE is ubiquitous in bacteria and is a widespread mitochondrial protein in eukaryotes, but is absent from archaea. The yeast member of TrmE family, MSS1, is involved in mitochondrial translation; bacterial members are often present in translation-related operons. FeoB represents an unusual adaptation of GTPases for high-affinity iron (II) transport. YihA (EngB) family of GTPases is typified by the E. coli YihA, which is an essential protein involved in cell division control. Era is characterized by a distinct derivative of the KH domain (the pseudo-KH domain) which is located C-terminal to the GTPase domain. EngA and its orthologs are composed of two GTPase domains and, since the sequences of the two domains are more similar to each other than to other GTPases, it is likely that an ancient gene duplication, rather than a fusion of evolutionarily distinct GTPases, gave rise to this family.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00882 Rat sarcoma (Ras)-like superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Ras-like GTPase superfamily. The Ras-like superfamily of small GTPases consists of several families with an extremely high degree of structural and functional similarity. The Ras superfamily is divided into at least four families in eukaryotes: the Ras, Rho, Rab, and Sar1/Arf families. This superfamily also includes proteins like the GTP translation factors, Era-like GTPases, and G-alpha chain of the heterotrimeric G proteins. Members of the Ras superfamily regulate a wide variety of cellular functions: the Ras family regulates gene expression, the Rho family regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression, the Rab and Sar1/Arf families regulate vesicle trafficking, and the Ran family regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport and microtubule organization. The GTP translation factor family regulates initiation, elongation, termination, and release in translation, and the Era-like GTPase family regulates cell division, sporulation, and DNA replication. Members of the Ras superfamily are identified by the GTP binding site, which is made up of five characteristic sequence motifs, and the switch I and switch II regions.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09912 Dynamin-like protein including dynamins, mitofusins, and guanylate-binding proteins. The dynamin family of large mechanochemical GTPases includes the classical dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (DLPs) that are found throughout the Eukarya. This family also includes bacterial DLPs. These proteins catalyze membrane fission during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Dynamin consists of five domains; an N-terminal G domain that binds and hydrolyzes GTP, a middle domain (MD) involved in self-assembly and oligomerization, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain responsible for interactions with the plasma membrane, GED, which is also involved in self-assembly, and a proline arginine rich domain (PRD) that interacts with SH3 domains on accessory proteins. To date, three vertebrate dynamin genes have been identified; dynamin 1, which is brain specific, mediates uptake of synaptic vesicles in presynaptic terminals; dynamin-2 is expressed ubiquitously and similarly participates in membrane fission; mutations in the MD, PH and GED domains of dynamin 2 have been linked to human diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathy and rare forms of centronuclear myopathy. Dynamin 3 participates in megakaryocyte progenitor amplification, and is also involved in cytoplasmic enlargement and the formation of the demarcation membrane system. This family also includes mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2 in mammals) that are involved in mitochondrial fusion. Dynamin oligomerizes into helical structures around the neck of budding vesicles in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04164 trmE is a tRNA modification GTPase. TrmE (MnmE, ThdF, MSS1) is a 3-domain protein found in bacteria and eukaryotes. It controls modification of the uridine at the wobble position (U34) of tRNAs that read codons ending with A or G in the mixed codon family boxes. TrmE contains a GTPase domain that forms a canonical Ras-like fold. It functions a molecular switch GTPase, and apparently uses a conformational change associated with GTP hydrolysis to promote the tRNA modification reaction, in which the conserved cysteine in the C-terminal domain is thought to function as a catalytic residue. In bacteria that are able to survive in extremely low pH conditions, TrmE regulates glutamate-dependent acid resistance.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04163 E. coli Ras-like protein (Era) is a multifunctional GTPase. Era (E. coli Ras-like protein) is a multifunctional GTPase found in all bacteria except some eubacteria. It binds to the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the 30S subunit and appears to play a role in the assembly of the 30S subunit, possibly by chaperoning the 16S rRNA. It also contacts several assembly elements of the 30S subunit. Era couples cell growth with cytokinesis and plays a role in cell division and energy metabolism. Homologs have also been found in eukaryotes. Era contains two domains: the N-terminal GTPase domain and a C-terminal domain KH domain that is critical for RNA binding. Both domains are important for Era function. Era is functionally able to compensate for deletion of RbfA, a cold-shock adaptation protein that is required for efficient processing of the 16S rRNA.</td>
