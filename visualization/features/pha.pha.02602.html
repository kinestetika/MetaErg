            <td id=al>atypical (a) SDRs, subgroup 5. This subgroup contains atypical SDRs, some of which are identified as putative NAD(P)-dependent epimerases, one as a putative NAD-dependent epimerase/dehydratase. Atypical SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. Members of this subgroup have a glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif that is very similar to the extended SDRs, GXXGXXG, and binds NADP. Generally, this subgroup has poor conservation of the active site tetrad; however, individual sequences do contain matches to the YXXXK active site motif, the upstream Ser, and there is a highly conserved Asp in place of the usual active site Asn throughout the subgroup. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Atypical SDRs include biliverdin IX beta reductase (BVR-B,aka flavin reductase), NMRa (a negative transcriptional regulator of various fungi), progesterone 5-beta-reductase like proteins, phenylcoumaran benzylic ether and pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases, phenylpropene synthases, eugenol synthase, triphenylmethane reductase, isoflavone reductases, and others. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. In addition to the Rossmann fold core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

            <td id=al>NmrA (a transcriptional regulator) and HSCARG (an NADPH sensor) like proteins, atypical (a) SDRs. NmrA and HSCARG like proteins. NmrA is a negative transcriptional regulator of various fungi, involved in the post-translational modulation of the GATA-type transcription factor AreA. NmrA lacks the canonical GXXGXXG NAD-binding motif and has altered residues at the catalytic triad, including a Met instead of the critical Tyr residue. NmrA may bind nucleotides but appears to lack any dehydrogenase activity. HSCARG has been identified as a putative NADP-sensing molecule, and redistributes and restructures in response to NADPH/NADP ratios. Like NmrA, it lacks most of the active site residues of the SDR family, but has an NAD(P)-binding motif similar to the extended SDR family, GXXGXXG. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

            <td id=al>triphenylmethane reductase (TMR)-like proteins, NMRa-like, atypical (a) SDRs. TMR is an atypical NADP-binding protein of the SDR family. It lacks the active site residues of the SDRs but has a glycine rich NAD(P)-binding motif that matches the extended SDRs. Proteins in this subgroup however, are more similar in length to the classical SDRs. TMR was identified as a reducer of triphenylmethane dyes, important environmental pollutants. This subgroup also includes Escherichia coli NADPH-dependent quinine oxidoreductase (QOR2), which catalyzes two-electron reduction of quinone; but is unlikely to play a major role in protecting against quinone cytotoxicity. Atypical SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. Atypical SDRs include biliverdin IX beta reductase (BVR-B,aka flavin reductase), NMRa (a negative transcriptional regulator of various fungi), progesterone 5-beta-reductase like proteins, phenylcoumaran benzylic ether and pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases, phenylpropene synthases, eugenol synthase, triphenylmethane reductase, isoflavone reductases, and others.

            <td id=al>biliverdin IX beta reductase (BVR-B, aka flavin reductase)-like proteins; atypical (a) SDRs. Human BVR-B catalyzes pyridine nucleotide-dependent production of bilirubin-IX beta during fetal development; in the adult BVR-B has flavin and ferric reductase activities. Human BVR-B catalyzes the reduction of FMN, FAD, and riboflavin. Recognition of flavin occurs mostly by hydrophobic interactions, accounting for the broad substrate specificity. Atypical SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. BVR-B does not share the key catalytic triad, or conserved tyrosine typical of SDRs. The glycine-rich NADP-binding motif of BVR-B is GXXGXXG, which is similar but not identical to the pattern seen in extended SDRs. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs.

            <td id=al>uncharacterized subgroup of aldehyde reductase and flavonoid reductase related proteins, extended (e) SDRs. This subgroup contains proteins of unknown function related to aldehyde reductase and flavonoid reductase of the extended SDR-type. Aldehyde reductase I (aka carbonyl reductase) is an NADP-binding SDR; it has an NADP-binding motif consensus that is slightly different from the canonical SDR form and lacks the Asn of the extended SDR active site tetrad. Aldehyde reductase I catalyzes the NADP-dependent  reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate. The related flavonoid reductases act in the NADP-dependent reduction of  flavonoids, ketone-containing plant secondary metabolites. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif.
