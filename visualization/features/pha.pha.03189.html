            <td id=al>phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosyltransferase. This family is most closely related to the GT4 family of glycosyltransferases and named after PimA in Propionibacterium freudenreichii, which is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIM) which are early precursors in the biosynthesis of lipomannans (LM) and lipoarabinomannans (LAM), and catalyzes the addition of a mannosyl residue from GDP-D-mannose (GDP-Man) to the position 2 of the carrier lipid phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) to generate a phosphatidyl-myo-inositol bearing an alpha-1,2-linked mannose residue (PIM1). Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. The acceptor molecule can be a lipid, a protein, a heterocyclic compound, or another carbohydrate residue. This group of glycosyltransferases is most closely related to the previously defined glycosyltransferase family 1 (GT1). The members of this family may transfer UDP, ADP, GDP, or CMP linked sugars. The diverse enzymatic activities among members of this family reflect a wide range of biological functions. The protein structure available for this family has the GTB topology, one of the two protein topologies observed for nucleotide-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases. GTB proteins have distinct N- and C- terminal domains each containing a typical Rossmann fold. The two domains have high structural homology despite minimal sequence homology. The large cleft that separates the two domains includes the catalytic center and permits a high degree of flexibility. The members of this family are found mainly in certain bacteria and archaea.</td>

Glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. The acceptor molecule can be a lipid, a protein, a heterocyclic compound, or another carbohydrate residue. This group of glycosyltransferases is most closely related to the previously defined glycosyltransferase family 1 (GT1). The members of this family may transfer UDP, ADP, GDP, or CMP linked sugars. The diverse enzymatic activities among members of this family reflect a wide range of biological functions. The protein structure available for this family has the GTB topology, one of the two protein topologies observed for nucleotide-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases. GTB proteins have distinct N- and C- terminal domains each containing a typical Rossmann fold. The two domains have high structural homology despite minimal sequence homology. The large cleft that separates the two domains includes the catalytic center and permits a high degree of flexibility. The members of this family are found mainly in bacteria, while some of them are also found in Archaea and eukaryotes.</td>

            <td id=al>mannosyltransferases of glycosyltransferase family 4 and similar proteins. This family is most closely related to the GT1 family of glycosyltransferases. ORF704 in E. coli has been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of O-specific mannose homopolysaccharides.</td>

            <td id=al>Glycogen synthase GlgA and similar proteins. This family is most closely related to the GT5 family of glycosyltransferases. Glycogen synthase (EC:2.4.1.21) catalyzes the formation and elongation of the alpha-1,4-glucose backbone using ADP-glucose, the second and key step of glycogen biosynthesis. This family includes starch synthases of plants, such as DULL1 in Zea mays and glycogen synthases of various organisms.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A and similar proteins. This family is most closely related to the GT4 family of glycosyltransferases. Phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A (PIG-A), an X-linked gene in humans, is necessary for the synthesis of N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol, a very early intermediate in glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis. The GPI-anchor is an important cellular structure that facilitates the attachment of many proteins to cell surfaces. Somatic mutations in PIG-A have been associated with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH), an acquired hematological disorder.</td>

            <td id=al>trehalose phosphorylase and similar proteins. Trehalose phosphorylase (TP) reversibly catalyzes trehalose synthesis and degradation from alpha-glucose-1-phosphate (alpha-Glc-1-P) and glucose. The catalyzing activity includes the phosphorolysis of trehalose, which produce alpha-Glc-1-P and glucose, and the subsequent synthesis of trehalose. This family is most closely related to the GT4 family of glycosyltransferases.</td>
