            <td id=al>TIGR02252 REG-2-like, HAD superfamily (subfamily IA) hydrolase. This family of proteins includes uncharacterized sequences from eukaryotes, cyanobacteria and Leptospira as well as the DREG-2 protein from Drosophila melanogaster which has been identified as a rhythmically (diurnally) regulated gene. This family is a member of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs. The subfamilies are defined based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called 'capping domain', or the absence of such a domain. This family is a member of subfamily 1A in which the cap domain consists of a predicted alpha helical bundle found in between the first and second catalytic motifs. A distinctive feature of this family is a conserved tandem pair of tryptophan residues in the cap domain. The most divergent sequences included within the scope of this model are from plants and have "FW" at this position instead. Most likely, these sequences, like the vast majority of HAD sequences, represent phosphatase enzymes.</td>

The haloacid dehalogenase-like (HAD) hydrolases are a large superfamily of diverse enzymes that catalyze carbon or phosphoryl group transfer reactions on a range of substrates, using an active site aspartate in nucleophilic catalysis. Members include 2-L-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (C-Cl bond hydrolysis), azetidine hydrolase (C-N bond hydrolysis); phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (C-P bond hydrolysis), phosphoserine phosphatase and phosphomannomutase (CO-P bond hydrolysis), P-type ATPases (PO-P bond hydrolysis) and many others. Members are found in all three kingdoms of life, and most genomes are predicted to contain multiple HAD-like proteins. Members possess a highly conserved alpha/beta core domain, and many also possess a small cap domain, the fold and function of which is variable. HAD hydrolases are sometimes referred to as belonging to the DDDD superfamily of phosphohydrolases.</td>

L-2-Haloacid dehalogenase catalyzes the hydrolytic dehalogenation of L-2-haloacids to produce the corresponding D-2-hydroxyacids with an inversion of the C2-configuration. 2-haloacid dehalogenases are of interest for their potential to degrade recalcitrant halogenated environmental pollutants and their use in the synthesis of industrial chemicals. This family belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase-like (HAD) hydrolases, a large superfamily of diverse enzymes that catalyze carbon or phosphoryl group transfer reactions on a range of substrates, using an active site aspartate in nucleophilic catalysis. Members of this superfamily include 2-L-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase, azetidine hydrolase, phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphomannomutase, P-type ATPases and many others.

This family includes L-2-haloacid dehalogenase, epoxide hydrolases and phosphatases. The structure of the family consists of two domains. One is an inserted four helix bundle, which is the least well conserved region of the alignment, between residues 16 and 96 of Pseudomonas sp. (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase 1. The rest of the fold is composed of the core alpha/beta domain. Those members with the characteristic DxD triad at the N-terminus are probably phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) phosphatases involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis in the mitochondria.</td>

N-acetylneuraminate-9- phosphatase (Neu5Ac-9-Pase; E.C. 3.1.3.29) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of N-acylneuraminate 9-phosphate during the synthesis of N-acetylneuraminate; Escherichia coli nucleotide phosphatase YjjG has a broad pyrimidine nucleotide activity spectrum and functions as an in vivo house-cleaning phosphatase for noncanonical pyrimidine nucleotides.

Belongs to the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases (pfam00702), class (subfamily) I. Note that the Type I HAD enzymes have not yet been fully characterized, but clearly utilize a substantially different catalytic mechanism and are thus unlikely to be related.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR01509 haloacid dehalogenase superfamily, subfamily IA, variant 3 with third motif having DD or ED. This model represents part of one structural subfamily of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs. The subfamilies are defined based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called "capping domain", or the absence of such a domain. Subfamily I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs. Subfamily II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs. Subfamily III sequences have no capping domain in either of these positions. The Subfamily IA and IB capping domains are predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of an alpha helical bundle. Subfamily I encompasses such a wide region of sequence space (the sequences are highly divergent) that representing it with a single model is impossible, resulting in an overly broad description which allows in many unrelated sequences. Subfamily IA and IB are separated based on an aparrent phylogenetic bifurcation. Subfamily IA is still too broad to model, but cannot be further subdivided into large chunks based on phylogenetic trees. Of the three motifs defining the HAD superfamily, the third has three variant forms: (1) hhhhsDxxx(x)D, (2) hhhhssxxx(x)D and (3) hhhhDDxxx(x)s where _s_ refers to a small amino acid and _h_ to a hydrophobic one. All three of these variants are found in subfamily IA. Individual models were made based on seeds exhibiting only one of the variants each. Variant 3 (this model) is found in the enzymes beta-phosphoglucomutase (TIGR01990) and deoxyglucose-6-phosphatase, while many other enzymes of subfamily IA exhibit this variant as well as variant 1 (TIGR01549). These three variant models were created with the knowledge that there will be overlap among them - this is by design and serves the purpose of eliminating the overlap with models of more distantly related HAD subfamilies caused by an overly broad single model.

This superfamily includes a variety of enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of substrate C-Cl, P-C, and P-OP bonds via nucleophilic substitution pathways. All of which use a nucleophilic aspartate in their phosphoryl transfer reaction. They catalyze nucleophilic substitution reactions at phosphorus or carbon centers, using a conserved Asp carboxylate in covalent catalysis. All members possess a highly conserved alpha/beta core domain, and many also possess a small cap domain, the fold and function of which is variable.

This family includes the N-terminal phosphatase domain of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). sEH is a bifunctional enzyme with two distinct enzyme activities, the C-terminal domain has epoxide hydrolysis activity and the N-terminal domain (Ntermphos), which belongs to this family, has lipid phosphatase activity. The latter prefers mono-phosphate esters, and lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are the best natural substrates found to date.  In addition this family includes Gallus gallus sEH and Xenopus sEH which appears to lack phosphatase activity, and Escherichia coli YihX/HAD4 which selectively hydrolyzes alpha-Glucose-1-P, phosphatase, has significant phosphatase activity against pyridoxal phosphate, and has low beta phosphoglucomutase activity.
