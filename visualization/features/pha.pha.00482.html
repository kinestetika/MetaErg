PA4781 is involved in cyclic di-3',5'-GMP (c-di-GMP) hydrolysis/degradation in a two-step reaction via the linear intermediate pGpG to produce GMP. Its unphosphorylated REC domain prevents accessibility of c-di-GMP to the active site.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of response regulators (RRs) and pseudo response regulators (PRRs). Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

DhkD activates the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA to ensure proper prestalk and prespore patterning, tip formation, and the vertical elongation of the mound into a finger, in Dictyostelium discoideum.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CKI1 and Escherichia coli RcsC. This family is composed of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators that are sensor histidine kinases (HKs) fused with a REC domain, similar to the sensor histidine kinase CKI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) signaling that mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. MSP involves a signal being transferred from HKs via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. The CKI1 REC domain specifically interacts with the downstream signaling protein AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. The plant MSP system has evolved from the prokaryotic two-component system (TCS), which allows organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. This family also includes bacterial hybrid sensor HKs such as Escherichia coli RcsC, which is a component of the Rcs signalling pathway that controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division, and motility. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of BsPhoP-like OmpR family response regulators. Bacillus subtilis PhoP (BsPhoP) is part of the PhoPR two-component system that participates in a signal transduction network that controls adaptation of the bacteria to phosphate deficiency by regulating (activating or repressing) genes of the Pho regulon upon phosphorylation by PhoR. When activated, PhoPR directs expression of phosphate scavenging enzymes, lowers synthesis of the phosphate-rich wall teichoic acid (WTA) and initiates synthesis of teichuronic acid, a non-phosphate containing replacement anionic polymer. Members of this subfamily belong to the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators, which are characterized by a REC domain and a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding output effector domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of Thermotoga maritima response regulator RR468 and similar domains. Thermotoga maritima RR468 (encoded by gene TM0468) is the cognate response regulator (RR) of the class I histidine kinase HK853 (product of gene TM0853). HK853/RR468 comprise a two-component system (TCS) that couples environmental stimuli to adaptive responses. This subfamily also includes Fremyella diplosiphon complementary adaptation response regulator homolog RcaF, a small RR that is involved in four-step phosphorelays of the complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA) system that occurs in many cyanobacteria. Both RR468 and RcaF are stand-alone RRs containing only a REC domain with no output/effector domain. The REC domain itself functions as an effector domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
