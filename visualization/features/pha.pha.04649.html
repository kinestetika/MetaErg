            <td id=al>Plastocyanin is a type I copper protein and functions in the electron transfer from PSII to PSI. Plastocyanin is a small copper-containing protein found in cyanobacteria, higher plants, and some algae, where it plays a role in photosynthesis. The two photosystems that are primarily responsible for photosynthesis are photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII). The flow of electrons begins in PSII, which acts as a proton pump. Plastocyanin is responsible for transporting electrons from PSII to PSI.</td>

Members of this family are plastocyanin, a blue copper protein related to pseudoazurin, halocyanin, amicyanin, etc. This protein, located in the thylakoid luman, performs electron transport to photosystem I in Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.

            <td id=al>Small blue copper proteins including pseudocyanin, plastocyanin, halocyanin and amicyanin. The Pseudocyanin-like family of copper-binding proteins (or blue (type 1) copper domain) is a family of small proteins that bind a single copper atom and are characterized by an intense electronic absorption band near 600 nm. Pseudoazurin (PAz) has been identified as a electron donor in the denitrification pathway. For example, PAz acts as an electron donor to cytochrome c peroxidase and N2OR from Paracoccus pantotrophus (Pp), and to the copper containing nitrite reductase (NiR) that catalyzes the second step of denitrification. Plastocyanin is found in cyanobacteria, higher plants, and some algae where it plays a role in photosynthesis.  Plastocyanin is responsible for transporting electrons from PSII to PSI. This family also includes halocyanins found in halophilic archaea such as Natronomonas pharaonis (Natronobacterium pharaonis) and amicyanin found in bacteria Paracoccus denitrificans.</td>

            <td id=al>Halocyanin is an archaea blue (type I) copper redox protein. Halocyanins are blue (type I) copper redox proteins found in halophilic archaea such as Natronomonas pharaonis (Natronobacterium pharaonis). Halocyanin may serve as a mobile electron carrier at a peripheral membrane protein. The copper-binding domain is present only once in some halocyanins and is duplicated in others.</td>

            <td id=al>Amicyanin is a type I blue copper protein that plays an essential role in electron transfer. In Paracoccus denitrificans bacteria, amicyanin acts as an intermediary of a three-member redox complex along with methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) and cytochrome c-551i. The electron is transferred from the active site of MADH via the amicyanin copper ion to the cytochrome heme iron. The electron transfer from MADH to cytochrome c-551i does not involve a ternary complex but occurs via a ping-pong mechanism in which amicyanin uses the same interface for the reactions with MADH and cytochrome c-551i.</td>

            <td id=al>Pseudoazurin (Paz) is a type I blue copper electron-transfer protein. Pseudoazurin (PAz) has been identified as an electron donor to the denitrification pathway. For example, PAz acts as an electron donor to cytochrome c peroxidase and N2OR from Paracoccus pantotrophus (Pp), and to the copper containing nitrite reductase (NiR) that catalyzes the second step of denitrification. It has been shown that pseudoazurin dramatically enhances the reaction profile of nitrite reduction by Paracoccus pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 and facilitates release of the product nitric oxide. The ability of this small redox protein to interact with a multitude of structurally different partners has been attributed to the hydrophobic character of the binding surface.</td>

            <td id=al>Auracyanins A and B and similar proteins. This subfamily includes both auracyanins A and B from the photosynthetic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus and similar proteins. Auracyanins A and B are very  similar blue copper proteins with 38% sequence identity and are homologous to the bacterial redox protein Azurin. However, auracyanin A is expressed only when C. aurantiacus cells are grown in light, whereas auracyanin B is expressed in both dark and light conditions. Thus, auracyanin A may function as a redox partner in photosynthesis, while auracyanin B may function in aerobic respiration.</td>

            <td id=al>Cupredoxin superfamily. Cupredoxins contain type I copper centers and are involved in inter-molecular electron transfer reactions. Cupredoxins are blue copper proteins, having an intense blue color due to the presence of a mononuclear type 1 (T1) copper site. Structurally, the cupredoxin-like fold consists of a beta-sandwich with 7 strands in 2 beta-sheets, which is arranged in a Greek-key beta-barrel. Some of these proteins have lost the ability to bind copper. The majority of family members contain multiple cupredoxin domain repeats: ceruloplasmin and the coagulation factors V/VIII have six repeats; laccase, ascorbate oxidase, spore coat protein A, and multicopper oxidase CueO contain three repeats; and nitrite reductase has two repeats. Others are mono-domain cupredoxins, such as plastocyanin, pseudoazurin, plantacyanin, azurin, rusticyanin, stellacyanin, quinol oxidase, and the periplasmic domain of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II.</td>
