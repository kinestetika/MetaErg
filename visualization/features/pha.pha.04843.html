The vWA domain, since its discovery, has drawn great interest because of its widespread occurrence and its involvement in a wide variety of important cellular functions. These include basal membrane formation, cell migration, cell differentiation, adhesion, haemostasis, signaling, chromosomal stability, malignant transformation and in immune defenses  In integrins these domains form heterodimers while in vWF it forms multimers. There are different interaction surfaces of this domain as seen by the various molecules it complexes with.

            <td id=al>cd01472 von Willebrand factor (vWF) type A domain; equivalent to the I-domain of integrins.  This domain has a variety of functions including: intermolecular adhesion, cell migration, signalling, transcription, and DNA repair. In integrins these domains form heterodimers while in vWF it forms homodimers and multimers. There are different interaction surfaces of this domain as seen by its complexes with collagen with either integrin or human vWFA. In integrins collagen binding occurs via  the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) and involves three surface loops located on the upper surface of the molecule. In human vWFA, collagen binding is thought to occur on the bottom of the molecule and does not involve the vestigial MIDAS motif.</td>

Collagens are centrally involved in the formation of fibrillar and microfibrillar networks of the extracellular matrix, basement membranes as well as other structures of the extracellular matrix. Some collagens have about 15-18 vWA domains in them. The VWA domains present in these collagens mediate protein-protein interactions.</td>

Because of their involvement in many biologically important adhesion processes, integrins are conserved across a wide range of multicellular animals. Integrins from invertebrates have been identified from six phyla. There are no data to date to suggest  any immunological functions for the invertebrate integrins. The members of this sub-group have the conserved MIDAS motif that is charateristic of this domain suggesting the involvement of the integrins in the recognition and binding of multi-ligands.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01461 vWA_interalpha trypsin inhibitor (ITI): ITI is a glycoprotein composed of three polypeptides- two heavy chains and one light chain (bikunin). Bikunin confers the protease-inhibitor function while the heavy chains are involved in rendering stability to the extracellular matrix by binding to hyaluronic acid. The heavy chains carry the VWA domain with a conserved MIDAS motif. Although the exact role of the VWA domains remains unknown, it has been speculated to be involved in mediating protein-protein interactions with the components of the extracellular matrix.</td>
