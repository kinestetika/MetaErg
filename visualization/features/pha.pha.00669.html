            <td id=al>cd16918 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli GlnL (synonyms NtrB and NRII). This family includes the histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domains of various two-component sensor histidine kinase (HKs), similar to Escherichia coli GlnL/NtrB/NRII HK of the two-component regulatory system (TCS) GlnL/GlnG (NtrB-NtrC, or NRII-NRI), which regulates the transcription of genes encoding metabolic enzymes and permeases in response to carbon and nitrogen status in E. coli and related bacteria. Also included in this family are Rhodobacter capsulatus NtrB, Azospirillum brasilense NtrB, Vibrio alginolyticus NtrB, Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar phaseoli NtrB, and Herbaspirillum seropedicae NtrB.  Escherichia coli GlnL/NtrB/NRII is both a kinase and a phosphatase, catalyzing the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of GlnG/NtrC/NRI. The kinase and phosphatase activities of GlnL/NtrB/NRII are regulated by the PII signal transduction protein, which on binding to GlnL/NtrB/NRII, inhibits the kinase activity of GlnL/NtrB/NRII and activates the GlnL/NtrB/NRII phosphatase activity. Proteins having this HATPase domain also have a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA); some also contain PAS sensor domain(s).</td>

This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase domains of Escherichia coli K-12 DpiB and DcuS, and Bacillus subtilis CitS, DctS and MalK histidine kinases (HKs) all of which are two component transduction systems (TCSs). E. coli K-12 DpiB (also known as CitA) is the histidine kinase (HK) of DpiA-DpiB, a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) required for the expression of citrate-specific fermentation genes and genes involved in plasmid inheritance. E. coli K-12 DcuS (also known as YjdH) is the HK of DcuS-DcuR, a TCS that in the presence of the extracellular C4-dicarboxlates, activates the expression of the genes of anaerobic fumarate respiration and of aerobic C4-dicarboxylate uptake. CitS is the HK of Bacillus subtilis CitS-CitT, a TCS which regulates expression of CitM, the Mg-citrate transporter. Bacillus subtilis DctS forms a tripartite sensor unit (DctS/DctA/DctB) for sensing C4 dicarboxylates.  Bacillus subtilis MalK (also known as YfuL) is the HK of MalK-MalR (YufL-YufM) a TCS which regulates the expression of the malate transporters MaeN (YufR) and YflS, and is essential for utilization of malate in minimal medium. Proteins having this DpiB-CitA-like HATPase domain generally have sensor domains such as Cache and PAS, and a histidine kinase A (HisKA)-like SpoOB-type, alpha-helical domain.</td>

This family includes the histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domains of various two-component sensor histidine kinase (HKs) such as Escherichia coli EnvZ of the EnvZ-OmpR two-component regulatory system (TCS), which functions in osmoregulation. It also contains the HATPase domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa BfmS, the HK of the BfmSR TCS, which functions in the regulation of the rhl quorum-sensing system and bacterial virulence in P. aeruginosa. Proteins having this HATPase domain also contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA) and a HAMP sensor domain; some also contain a periplasmic domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16938 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of Arabidopsis thaliana ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4, and related domains. This family includes the histidine kinase-like ATPase domains (HATPase) of three out of the five receptors that recognize the plant hormone ethylene in Arabidopsis thaliana. These three proteins have been classified as belonging to subfamily 2: ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4. They lack most of the motifs characteristic of histidine kinases, and EIN4 is the only one in this group containing the conserved histidine that is phosphorylated in two-component and phosphorelay systems. This family also includes the HATPase domains of Escherichia coli RcsD phosphotransferase which is a component of the Rcs-signaling system, a complex multistep phosphorelay involving five proteins, and is involved in many transcriptional networks such as cell division, biofilm formation, and virulence, among others. Also included is Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mak3 (Phk1) which participates in a multi-step two-component related system which regulates H2O2-induced activation of the Sty1 stress-activated protein kinase pathway. Most proteins having this HATPase domain also contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA), and a GAF sensor domain; most are hybrid sensor histidine kinases as they also contain a REC signal receiver domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17546 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CKI1 and Escherichia coli RcsC. This family is composed of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators that are sensor histidine kinases (HKs) fused with a REC domain, similar to the sensor histidine kinase CKI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) signaling that mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. MSP involves a signal being transferred from HKs via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. The CKI1 REC domain specifically interacts with the downstream signaling protein AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. The plant MSP system has evolved from the prokaryotic two-component system (TCS), which allows organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. This family also includes bacterial hybrid sensor HKs such as Escherichia coli RcsC, which is a component of the Rcs signalling pathway that controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division, and motility. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
