FilI-FilRs catalyzes the phosphotransfer between FilI (HK) and FilRs (FilR1 and FilR2, response regulators) of the TCS. TCSs are predicted to be of bacterial origin, and acquired by archaea by horizontal gene transfer. This model also includes related HATPase domains such as that of Synechocystis sp.

            <td id=al>cd16952 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoR. This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli or Vibrio cholera PhoR, the histidine kinase (HK) of PhoB-PhoR a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) involved in phosphate regulation. PhoR monitors extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability and PhoB, the response regulator, regulates transcription of genes of the phosphate regulon. PhoR is a bifunctional histidine autokinase/phospho-PhoB phosphatase; in phosphate deficiency, it autophosphorylates and Pi is transferred to PhoB, and when environmental Pi is abundant, it removes the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated PhoB. Other roles of PhoB-PhoR TCS have been described, including motility, biofilm formation, intestinal colonization, and virulence in V. cholera. E.coli PhoR and Bacillus subtilis PhoR (whose HATPase domain belongs to a different family) sense very different signals in each bacterium. In E. coli the PhoR signal comes from phosphate transport mediated by the PstSCAB2 phosphate transporter and the PhoU chaperone-like protein while in B. subtilis, the PhoR activation signal comes from wall teichoic acid (WTA) metabolism.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16938 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of Arabidopsis thaliana ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4, and related domains. This family includes the histidine kinase-like ATPase domains (HATPase) of three out of the five receptors that recognize the plant hormone ethylene in Arabidopsis thaliana. These three proteins have been classified as belonging to subfamily 2: ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4. They lack most of the motifs characteristic of histidine kinases, and EIN4 is the only one in this group containing the conserved histidine that is phosphorylated in two-component and phosphorelay systems. This family also includes the HATPase domains of Escherichia coli RcsD phosphotransferase which is a component of the Rcs-signaling system, a complex multistep phosphorelay involving five proteins, and is involved in many transcriptional networks such as cell division, biofilm formation, and virulence, among others. Also included is Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mak3 (Phk1) which participates in a multi-step two-component related system which regulates H2O2-induced activation of the Sty1 stress-activated protein kinase pathway. Most proteins having this HATPase domain also contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA), and a GAF sensor domain; most are hybrid sensor histidine kinases as they also contain a REC signal receiver domain.</td>
