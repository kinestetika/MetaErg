Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor which functions as the substrate recognition component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA. It regulates polymerase II transcription and is also required for efficient transcription by RNA polymerase I, and more specifically the polymerase I transcription termination step. It is not only involved in transcription-related chromatin-remodeling, but is also required to maintain a specific chromatin configuration across the genome. CHD1 is also associated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 2 (CHD2) is a DNA-binding helicase that specifically binds to the promoter of target genes, leading to chromatin remodeling, possibly by promoting deposition of histone H3.3. It is involved in myogenesis via interaction with MYOD1; it binds to myogenic gene regulatory sequences and mediates incorporation of histone H3.3 prior to the onset of myogenic gene expression, promoting their expression. Both are members of the DEAD-like helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.</td>

Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a component of the histone deacetylase NuRD complex which participates in the remodeling of chromatin by deacetylating histones. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a chromatin-remodeling protein that binds DNA through histones and regulates gene transcription. It is thought to specifically recognize and bind trimethylated 'Lys-27' (H3K27me3) and non-methylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3 and plays a role in the development of the nervous system by activating the expression of genes promoting neuron terminal differentiation. In parallel, it may also positively regulate the trimethylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-27' thereby specifically repressing genes that promote the differentiation into non-neuronal cell lineages. As a tumor suppressor, it regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. In spermatogenesis, it probably regulates histone hyperacetylation and the replacement of histones by transition proteins in chromatin, a crucial step in the condensation of spermatid chromatin and the production of functional spermatozoa.
