This family contains the histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domains of various two-component hybrid sensor histidine kinases (HKs), including the following Escherichia coli HKs: EvgS, a HK of the EvgS-EvgA two-component system (TCS) that confers acid resistance; ArcB, a HK of the ArcB-ArcA TCS that modulates the expression of numerous genes in response to respiratory growth conditions; TorS, a HK of the TorS-TorR TCS which is involved in the anaerobic utilization of trimethylamine-N-oxide; BarA, a HK of the BarA-UvrY TCS involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism; and RcsC, a HK of the RcsB-RcsC TCS which regulates the expression of the capsule operon and of the cell division gene ftsZ. Proteins having this HATPase domain also contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA), with most having accessory sensor domain(s) such as GAF, PAS and CHASE; many are hybrid sensor histidine kinases as they also contain a REC signal receiver domain.</td>

This family includes FilI, the histidine kinase (HK) component of FilI-FilRs, a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanosaeta harundinacea, which is involved in regulating methanogenesis. The cytoplasmic HK core consists of a C-terminal HK-like ATPase domain (represented here) and a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA) domain, which, in FilI, are coupled to CHASE, HAMP, PAS, and GAF sensor domains. FilI-FilRs catalyzes the phosphotransfer between FilI (HK) and FilRs (FilR1 and FilR2, response regulators) of the TCS. TCSs are predicted to be of bacterial origin, and acquired by archaea by horizontal gene transfer. This model also includes related HATPase domains such as that of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 phytochrome-like protein Cph1. Proteins having this HATPase domain and HisKA domain also have accessory sensor domains such as CHASE, GAF, HAMP and PAS; some are  hybrid sensor histidine kinases as they also contain a REC signal receiver domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16952 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoR. This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli or Vibrio cholera PhoR, the histidine kinase (HK) of PhoB-PhoR a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) involved in phosphate regulation. PhoR monitors extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability and PhoB, the response regulator, regulates transcription of genes of the phosphate regulon. PhoR is a bifunctional histidine autokinase/phospho-PhoB phosphatase; in phosphate deficiency, it autophosphorylates and Pi is transferred to PhoB, and when environmental Pi is abundant, it removes the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated PhoB. Other roles of PhoB-PhoR TCS have been described, including motility, biofilm formation, intestinal colonization, and virulence in V. cholera. E.coli PhoR and Bacillus subtilis PhoR (whose HATPase domain belongs to a different family) sense very different signals in each bacterium. In E. coli the PhoR signal comes from phosphate transport mediated by the PstSCAB2 phosphate transporter and the PhoU chaperone-like protein while in B. subtilis, the PhoR activation signal comes from wall teichoic acid (WTA) metabolism.</td>

Adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases catalyze ATP and GTP to the second messengers cAMP and cGMP, respectively, these products up-regulating catalytic activity by binding to the regulatory GAF domain(s). The opposite hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by phosphodiesterase. cGMP-dependent 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase catalyzes the conversion of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate to guanosine 5'-phosphate. Here too, cGMP regulates catalytic activity by GAF-domain binding. Phytochromes are regulatory photoreceptors in plants and bacteria which exist in two thermally-stable states that are reversibly inter-convertible by light: the Pr state absorbs maximally in the red region of the spectrum, while the Pfr state absorbs maximally in the far-red region. This domain is also found in FhlA (formate hydrogen lyase transcriptional activator) and NifA, a transcriptional activator which is required for activation of most Nif operons which are directly involved in nitrogen fixation. NifA interacts with sigma-54.</td>

The AarG product is similar to PhoQ in that it is able to restore wild-type levels of resistance to a Salmonella typhimurium phoQ mutant. However, the expression of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase gene and of aarP (a gene encoding a transcriptional activator of 2'-N-acetyltransferase) are not significantly affected by the levels of Mg2+ or Ca2+.
