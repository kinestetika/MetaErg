            <td id=al>cd16952 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoR. This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli or Vibrio cholera PhoR, the histidine kinase (HK) of PhoB-PhoR a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) involved in phosphate regulation. PhoR monitors extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability and PhoB, the response regulator, regulates transcription of genes of the phosphate regulon. PhoR is a bifunctional histidine autokinase/phospho-PhoB phosphatase; in phosphate deficiency, it autophosphorylates and Pi is transferred to PhoB, and when environmental Pi is abundant, it removes the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated PhoB. Other roles of PhoB-PhoR TCS have been described, including motility, biofilm formation, intestinal colonization, and virulence in V. cholera. E.coli PhoR and Bacillus subtilis PhoR (whose HATPase domain belongs to a different family) sense very different signals in each bacterium. In E. coli the PhoR signal comes from phosphate transport mediated by the PstSCAB2 phosphate transporter and the PhoU chaperone-like protein while in B. subtilis, the PhoR activation signal comes from wall teichoic acid (WTA) metabolism.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16921 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Methanosaeta harundinacea FilI and some hybrid sensor histidine kinases. This family includes FilI, the histidine kinase (HK) component of FilI-FilRs, a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanosaeta harundinacea, which is involved in regulating methanogenesis. The cytoplasmic HK core consists of a C-terminal HK-like ATPase domain (represented here) and a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA) domain, which, in FilI, are coupled to CHASE, HAMP, PAS, and GAF sensor domains. FilI-FilRs catalyzes the phosphotransfer between FilI (HK) and FilRs (FilR1 and FilR2, response regulators) of the TCS. TCSs are predicted to be of bacterial origin, and acquired by archaea by horizontal gene transfer. This model also includes related HATPase domains such as that of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 phytochrome-like protein Cph1. Proteins having this HATPase domain and HisKA domain also have accessory sensor domains such as CHASE, GAF, HAMP and PAS; some are  hybrid sensor histidine kinases as they also contain a REC signal receiver domain.</td>

            <td id=al>NF033792 ActS/PrrB/RegB family redox-sensitive histidine kinase. This redox-responsive histidine kinase, found in alpha-proteobacteria, shows strong sequence conservation, including the notable motif [VA]AAAAHELGTPxTI. It always acts as a partner to an ActR/PrrA/RegA family global response regulator transcription factor in a two-component sensory transduction system. Lineage-specific names and gene symbols given to this histidine kinase reflect downstream regulator changes such as entry into stationary phase, anaerobic expression of photosynthesis genes, and survival of exposure to low pH.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16944 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Azorhizobium caulinodans NtrY. This family includes the histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domains of various histidine kinases (HKs) of two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) such as Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 NtrY of the NtrY-NtrX TCS, which is involved in nitrogen fixation and metabolism. Proteins having this HATPase domain also contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA) and a HAMP sensor domain; some also have PAS sensor domains.</td>
