            <td id=al>cd07333 Peptidase M48C Ste24p bepA-like, integral membrane protein. This family contains peptidase M48C Ste24p protease bepA (formerly yfgC)-like proteins considered to be putative metallopeptidases, containing a zinc-binding motif, HEXXH, and a COOH-terminal ER retrieval signal (KKXX). They proteolytically remove the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated proteins. They are integral membrane proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi, binding one zinc ion per subunit.  In eukaryotes, Ste24p is required for the first NH2-terminal proteolytic processing event within the a-factor precursor, which takes place after COOH-terminal CAAX modification (C is cysteine; A is usually aliphatic; X is one of several amino acids) is complete. Mutation studies have shown that the HEXXH protease motif, which is extracellular but adjacent to a transmembrane domain and therefore close to the membrane surface, is critical for Ste24p activity.  Several members of this family also contain tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat motifs, which are involved in a variety of functions including protein-protein interactions. BepA has been shown to possess protease activity and is responsible for the degradation of incorrectly folded LptD, an essential outer-membrane protein (OMP) involved in OM transport and assembly of lipopolysaccharide. Overexpression of the bepA protease causes abnormal biofilm architecture.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07324 Oma1 peptidase-like, integral membrane metallopeptidase. This family contains peptidase M48 subfamily C (also known as Oma1 peptidase or mitochondrial metalloendopeptidase OMA1), including similar peptidases containing tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, as well as uncharacterized proteins such as E. coli bepA (formerly yfgC), ycaL and loiP (formerly yggG), considered to be putative metallopeptidases. Oma1 peptidase is part of the quality control system in the inner membrane of mitochondria, with its catalytic site facing the matrix space. It cleaves and thereby promotes the turnover of mistranslated or misfolded membrane proteins. Oma1 can cleave the misfolded multi-pass membrane protein Oxa1, thus exerting a function similar to the ATP-dependent m-AAA protease for quality control of inner membrane proteins. It has been proposed that in the absence of m-AAA protease, proteolysis of Oxa1 is mediated by Oma1 in an ATP-independent manner. Homologs of Oma1 are present in higher eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaebacteria, suggesting that Oma1 is the founding member of a conserved family of membrane-embedded metallopeptidases, all containing the zinc metalloprotease motif (HEXXH). M48 peptidases proteolytically remove the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated proteins.</td>

It has been proposed that in the absence of m-AAA protease, proteolysis of Oxa1 is mediated by Oma1 in an ATP-independent manner. Oma1 is part of highly conserved mitochondrial metallopeptidases, with homologs present in higher eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaebacteria, all containing the zinc binding motif (HEXXH). It forms a high molecular mass complex in the inner membrane, possibly a homo-hexamer.</td>

This subfamily contains peptidase M48 Ste24p protease loiP (formerly yggG)-like family are mostly uncharacterized proteins that include E. coli loiP and ycaLG, considered to be putative metallopeptidases, containing a zinc-binding motif, HEXXH, and a COOH-terminal ER retrieval signal (KKXX). They proteolytically remove the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated proteins.

Mutation studies have shown that the HEXXH protease motif, which is extracellular but adjacent to a transmembrane domain and therefore close to the membrane surface, is critical for Ste24p activity. LoiP has been shown to be a metallopeptidase that cleaves its targets preferentially between Phe-Phe residues. It is upregulated when bacteria are subjected to media of low osmolarity, thus yggG was named LoiP (low osmolarity induced protease). Proper membrane localization of LoiP may depend on YfgC, another putative metalloprotease in this subfamily.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07337 Peptidase M48 subfamily B HtpX-like membrane-bound metallopeptidase. This HtpX family of peptidase M48 subfamily B includes uncharacterized HtpX homologs and consists of proteins smaller than Ste24p, with homology restricted to the C-terminal half of Ste24p. HtpX expression is controlled by the Cpx stress response system, which senses abnormal membrane proteins. HtpX participates in the proteolytic quality control of these misfolded proteins by undergoing self-degradation and collaborating with FtsH, a membrane-bound and ATP-dependent protease, to eliminate them. HtpX, a zinc metalloprotease with an active site motif HEXXH, has an FtsH-like topology, and is capable of introducing endoproteolytic cleavages into SecY (also an FtsH substrate). However, HtpX does not have an ATPase activity and will only act against cytoplasmic regions of a target membrane protein. Thus, HtpX and FtsH have overlapping and/or complementary functions, which are especially important at high temperature; in E. coli and Xylella fastidiosa, HtpX is heat-inducible, while in Streptococcus gordonii it is not.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05843 Peptidases M48 (Ste24 endopeptidase or htpX homolog) and M56 (in MecR1 and BlaR1), integral membrane metallopeptidases. This family contains peptidase M48 (also known as Ste24 peptidase, Ste24p, Ste24 endopeptidase, a-factor converting enzyme, AFC1), M56 (also known as BlaR1 peptidase) as well as a novel family called minigluzincins. Peptidase M48 belongs to Ste24 endopeptidase family. Members of this family include Ste24 protease (peptidase M48A), protease htpX homolog (peptidase M48B), or CAAX prenyl protease 1, and mitochondrial metalloendopeptidase OMA1 (peptidase M48C). They proteolytically remove the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated proteins. They are integral membrane proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi, binding one zinc ion per subunit. In eukaryotes, Ste24p is required for the first NH2-terminal proteolytic processing event within the a-factor precursor, which takes place after COOH-terminal CAAX modification (C is cysteine; A is usually aliphatic; X is one of several amino acids) is complete. The Ste24p contains multiple membrane spans, a zinc metalloprotease motif (HEXXH), and a COOH-terminal ER retrieval signal (KKXX). Mutation studies have shown that the HEXXH protease motif, which is extracellular but adjacent to a transmembrane domain and therefore close to the membrane surface, is critical for Ste24p activity. Ste24p has limited homology to HtpX family of prokaryotic proteins; HtpX proteins, also part of the M48 peptidase family, are smaller and homology is restricted to the C-terminal half of Ste24p. HtpX expression is controlled by the Cpx stress response system, which senses abnormal membrane proteins; HtpX then undergoes self-degradation and collaborates with FtsH to eliminate these misfolded proteins. Peptidase M56 includes zinc metalloprotease domain in MecR1 and BlaR1. MecR1 is a transmembrane beta-lactam sensor/signal transducer protein that regulates the expression of an altered penicillin-binding protein PBP2a, which resists inactivation by beta-lactam antibiotics, in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). BlaR1 regulates the inducible expression of a class A beta-lactamase that hydrolytically destroys certain beta-lactam antibiotics in MRSA. Also included are a novel family of related proteins that consist of the soluble minimal scaffold similar to the catalytic domains of the integral-membrane metallopeptidase M48 and M56, thus called minigluzincins.</td>

This family contains peptidase M48 family Ste24p-like proteins that are as yet uncharacterized, but probably function as intracellular, membrane-associated zinc metalloproteases; they all contain the HEXXH Zn-binding motif, which is critical for Ste24p activity. They likely remove the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated proteins proteolytically and are possibly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi. Some members also contain ankyrin domains which occur in very diverse families of proteins and mediate protein-protein interactions.</td>
