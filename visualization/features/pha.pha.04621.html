            <td id=al>cd04595 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the DHH and nucleotidyltransferase (NT) domains. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with an upstream DHH domain which performs a phosphoesterase function and a downstream nucleotidyltransferase (NT) domain of family X DNA polymerases. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>cd05398 Nucleotidyltransferase (NT) domain of ClassII CCA-adding enzymes. CCA-adding enzymes add the sequence [cytidine(C)-cytidine-adenosine (A)], one nucleotide at a time, onto the 3' end of tRNA, in a template-independent reaction. This Class II group is comprised mainly of eubacterial and eukaryotic enzymes and includes Bacillus stearothermophilus CCAase, Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase I, human mitochondrial CCAase, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCAase (CCA1). CCA-adding enzymes have a single catalytic pocket, which recognizes both ATP and CTP substrates. Included in this subgroup are CC- and A-adding enzymes from various ancient species of bacteria such as Aquifex aeolicus; these enzymes collaborate to add CCA to tRNAs. This family belongs to the Pol beta-like NT superfamily. In the majority of enzymes in this superfamily, two carboxylates, Dx[D/E], together with a third more distal carboxylate, coordinate two divalent metal cations involved in a two-metal ion mechanism of nucleotide addition. These carboxylate residues are fairly well conserved in this family. Escherichia coli CCAase is related to this group but has not been included in this alignment as this enzyme lacks the N-terminal helix conserved in the remainder of the NT superfamily.</td>

BON is a putative phospholipid-binding domain found in a family of osmotic shock protection proteins. It is also found in some secretins and a group of potential haemolysins.

            <td id=al>cd04584 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the ACT domain. The putative Acetoin Utilization Protein (Acub) from Vibrio Cholerae contains a CBS pair domain.  The acetoin utilization protein plays a role in growth and sporulation on acetoin or butanediol for use as a carbon source. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms.  It is used as an external energy store by a number of fermentive bacteria. Acetoin is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be utilised in order to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA or 2,3-butanediol is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex and acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, respectively. Acetoin utilization proteins, acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, and histone deacetylases are members of an ancient protein superfamily.This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in the acetoin utilization proteins in bacteria. Acetoin is a product of fermentative metabolism in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms.  They produce acetoin as an external carbon storage compound and then later reuse it as a carbon and energy source during their stationary phase and sporulation. In addition these CBS domains are associated with a downstream ACT (aspartate kinase/chorismate mutase/TyrA) domain, which is linked to a wide range of metabolic enzymes that are regulated by amino acid concentration. Pairs of ACT domains bind specifically to a particular amino acid leading to regulation of the linked enzyme. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.

In addition these CBS domains are associated with a downstream ACT (aspartate kinase/chorismate mutase/TyrA) domain, which is linked to a wide range of metabolic enzymes that are regulated by amino acid concentration. Pairs of ACT domains bind specifically to a particular amino acid leading to regulation of the linked enzyme. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>cd04584 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the ACT domain. The putative Acetoin Utilization Protein (Acub) from Vibrio Cholerae contains a CBS pair domain.  The acetoin utilization protein plays a role in growth and sporulation on acetoin or butanediol for use as a carbon source. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms.  It is used as an external energy store by a number of fermentive bacteria. Acetoin is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be utilised in order to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA or 2,3-butanediol is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex and acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, respectively. Acetoin utilization proteins, acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, and histone deacetylases are members of an ancient protein superfamily.This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in the acetoin utilization proteins in bacteria.

This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the voltage gated CLC voltage-gated chloride channel.  The CBS pairs here are found in the EriC CIC-type chloride channels in eukaryotes and bacteria. These ion channels are proteins with a seemingly simple task of allowing the passive flow of chloride ions across biological membranes. CIC-type chloride channels come from all kingdoms of life, have several gene families, and can be gated by voltage. The members of the CIC-type chloride channel are double-barreled: two proteins forming homodimers at a broad interface formed by four helices from each protein. The two pores are not found at this interface, but are completely contained within each subunit, as deduced from the mutational analyses, unlike many other channels, in which four or five identical or structurally related subunits jointly form one pore.

            <td id=al>cd17779 signal transduction protein with CBS domains. Archeal gamma-subunit of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contains four CBS domains in tandem repeats, similar to eukaryotic homologs. AMPK is an important regulator of metabolism and of energy homeostasis. It is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic serine/threonine kinase subunit (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta and gamma). The gamma subunit senses the intracellular energy status by competitively binding AMP and ATP and is believed to be responsible for allosteric regulation of the whole complex. In humans mutations in gamma- subunit of AMPK are associated with hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and glycogen storage in the skeletal muscle. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04583 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains found associated with the ABC transporter OpuCA. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains found in association with the ABC transporter OpuCA. OpuCA is the ATP binding component of a bacterial solute transporter that serves a protective role to cells growing in a hyperosmolar environment but the function of the CBS domains in OpuCA remains unknown.  In the related ABC transporter, OpuA, the tandem CBS domains have been shown to function as sensors for ionic strength, whereby they control the transport activity through an electronic switching mechanism. ABC transporters are a large family of proteins involved in the transport of a wide variety of different compounds, like sugars, ions, peptides, and more complex organic molecules. They are a subset of nucleotide hydrolases that contain a signature motif, Q-loop, and H-loop/switch region, in addition to the Walker A motif/P-loop and Walker B motif commonly found in a number of ATP- and GTP-binding and hydrolyzing proteins. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>
