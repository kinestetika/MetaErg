            <td id=al>GDP-fucose synthetase, extended (e) SDRs. GDP-fucose synthetase (aka 3, 5-epimerase-4-reductase) acts in the NADP-dependent synthesis of GDP-fucose from GDP-mannose. Two activities have been proposed for the same active site: epimerization and reduction. Proteins in this subgroup are extended SDRs, which have a characteristic active site tetrad and an NADP-binding motif, [AT]GXXGXXG, that is a close match to the archetypical form. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

Members include Arabidopsis thaliana GDP-mannose-3',5'-epimerase (GME) which catalyzes the epimerization of two positions of GDP-alpha-D-mannose to form GDP-beta-L-galactose.

This subgroup contains dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase and related proteins, members of the extended-SDR family, with the characteristic Rossmann fold core region, active site tetrad and NAD(P)-binding motif. dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase is closely related to other sugar epimerases of the SDR family. dTDP-D-dlucose 4,6,-dehydratase catalyzes the second of four steps in the dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway (the dehydration of dTDP-D-glucose to dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose) in the synthesis of L-rhamnose, a cell wall component of some pathogenic bacteria. In many gram negative bacteria, L-rhamnose is an important constituent of lipopoylsaccharide O-antigen. The larger N-terminal portion of dTDP-D-Glucose 4,6-dehydratase forms a Rossmann fold NAD-binding domain, while the C-terminus binds the sugar substrate.

This subgroup partially conserves the characteristic active site tetrad and NAD-binding motif of the extended SDRs, and has been identified as possible UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (aka UDP-galactose 4-epimerase), a homodimeric member of the extended SDR family. UDP-glucose 4-epimerase catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose, the final step in Leloir galactose synthesis. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs.

It is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the NAD-dependent decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid and N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent formylation of UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose; its NAD-dependent decaboxylating activity is in the C-terminal 360 residues.

In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

This subgroup includes an unusual bifunctional 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase from Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG26, a 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase, involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol of yeast. It also includes human 3 beta-HSD/HSD3B1 and C(27) 3beta-HSD/ [3beta-hydroxy-delta(5)-C(27)-steroid oxidoreductase; HSD3B7].  C(27) 3beta-HSD/HSD3B7 is a membrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum, that catalyzes the isomerization and oxidation of 7alpha-hydroxylated sterol intermediates, an early step in bile acid biosynthesis. Mutations in the human NSDHL (NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein) cause CHILD syndrome (congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects), an X-linked dominant, male-lethal trait.

            <td id=al>human NSDHL (NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein)-like, extended (e) SDRs. This subgroup includes human NSDHL and related proteins. These proteins have the characteristic active site tetrad of extended SDRs, and also have a close match to their  NAD(P)-binding motif.  Human NSDHL is a 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) which functions in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.  3 beta-HSD catalyzes the oxidative conversion of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids to the delta 4-3-keto configuration; this activity is essential for the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. Mutations in the gene encoding NSDHL cause CHILD syndrome (congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects), an X-linked dominant, male-lethal trait.  This subgroup also includes an unusual bifunctional [3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3b-HSD)/C-4 decarboxylase from Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG26, a 3b-HSD/C-4 decarboxylase, involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol of yeast.  Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid sythase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.</td>

            <td id=al>atypical (a) SDRs, subgroup 1. Atypical SDRs in this subgroup are poorly defined and have been identified putatively as isoflavones reductase, sugar dehydratase, mRNA binding protein etc. Atypical SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. Members of this subgroup retain the canonical active site triad (though not the upstream Asn found in most SDRs) but have an unusual putative glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif, GGXXXXG, in the usual location. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Atypical SDRs include biliverdin IX beta reductase (BVR-B,aka flavin reductase), NMRa (a negative transcriptional regulator of various fungi), progesterone 5-beta-reductase like proteins, phenylcoumaran benzylic ether and pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases, phenylpropene synthases, eugenol synthase, triphenylmethane reductase, isoflavone reductases, and others. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

            <td id=al>UDP-glucose 4 epimerase (G4E), subgroup 3, extended (e) SDRs. Members of this bacterial subgroup are identified as possible sugar epimerases, such as UDP-glucose 4 epimerase. However, while the NAD(P)-binding motif is fairly well conserved, not all members retain the canonical active site tetrad of the extended SDRs. UDP-glucose 4 epimerase (aka UDP-galactose-4-epimerase), is a homodimeric extended SDR. It catalyzes the NAD-dependent conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose, the final step in Leloir galactose synthesis. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids.

            <td id=al>CDP-tyvelose 2-epimerase, extended (e) SDRs. CDP-tyvelose 2-epimerase is a tetrameric SDR that catalyzes the conversion of CDP-D-paratose to CDP-D-tyvelose, the last step in tyvelose biosynthesis. This subgroup is a member of the extended SDR subfamily, with a characteristic active site tetrad and NAD-binding motif. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids.

            <td id=al>UDP-Glcnac (UDP-linked N-acetylglucosamine) inverting 4,6-dehydratase, extended (e) SDRs. UDP-Glcnac inverting 4,6-dehydratase was identified in Helicobacter pylori as the hexameric flaA1 gene product (FlaA1). FlaA1 is hexameric, possesses UDP-GlcNAc-inverting 4,6-dehydratase activity,  and catalyzes the first step in the creation of a pseudaminic acid derivative in protein glycosylation. Although this subgroup has the NADP-binding motif characteristic of extended SDRs, its members tend to have a Met substituted for the active site Tyr found in most SDR families.
