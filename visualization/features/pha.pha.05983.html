            <td id=al>cd16339 S-type phycobiliprotein (PBP) lyase. This family contains the S-type phycobiliprotein (PBP) lyase (denoted CpcS/CpcU or CpeS/CpeU). PBP lyases are employed by cyanobacteria, red algae, cryptophytes and glaucophytes for light-harvesting. Pigmentation of light-harvesting phycobiliproteins of cyanobacteria and cryptophytes requires covalent attachment of open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores, the phycobilins, to the apoproteins. PBP lyases mediate this covalent attachment of phycobilin chromophores to apo-PBPs and also ensure the correct binding of the chromophore with regard to the specific attachment site and stereospecificity. The S-type lyase is distantly related to CpcT and similarly adopts a beta-barrel structure with a modified lipocalin fold. Many members of the CpcS/CpcU family ligate phycocyanobilin (PCB) to a specific cysteine residue in the beta-subunits of phycocyanin (CpcB) or phycoerythrocyanin (PecB) and to a related cysteine residue in the alpha and beta subunits of allophycocyanin (AP); they are typically given the designation of "CpcS" or "CpcU". Other members which attach phycoerythrobilin (PEB) to the beta-subunit of phycoerythrin (PE) are given the designation "CpeS" or "CpeU". In Guillardia theta, a Cryptophyte, which has adopted phycoerythrobilin (PEB) biosynthesis from cyanobacteria, phycobiliprotein lyase has been shown to provide structural requirements for the transfer of this chromophore to the specific cysteine residue of the apophycobiliprotein.</td>

            <td id=al>cd19433 CpcS/CpeS phycobiliprotein lyase family. Phycobilin lyases covalently attach a chromophore to the Cys residue(s) of cyanobacterial phycobiliproteins. They include Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 phycocyanobilin lyase CpcS which attaches a phycocyanobilin chromophore to C-phycocyanain beta subunit and to allophycocyanin alpha and beta subunits, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 phycocyanobilin lyase subunit CpcU which forms a heterodimer with CpcS-I to attach phycocyanobilin to beta-phycocyanin and to allophycocyanin subunits, and Prochlorococcus marinus phycoerythrobilin lyase CpeS which attaches 3Z-phycoerythrobilin to phycoerythrin. This group belongs to the lipocalin/cytosolic fatty-acid binding protein family which have a large beta-barrel ligand-binding cavity. Lipocalins are mainly low molecular weight extracellular proteins that bind principally small hydrophobic ligands, and form covalent or non-covalent complexes with soluble macromolecules, as well as membrane bound-receptors. They participate in processes such as ligand transport, modulation of cell growth and metabolism, regulation of immune response, smell reception, tissue development and animal behavior. Cytosolic fatty-acid binding proteins, also bind hydrophobic ligands in a non-covalent, reversible manner, and have been implicated in intracellular uptake, transport and storage of hydrophobic ligands, regulation of lipid metabolism and sequestration of excess toxic fatty acids, as well as in signaling, gene expression, inflammation, cell growth and proliferation, and cancer development.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16340 S- and T-type phycobiliprotein (PBP) lyases. This family contains the S- and T-type phycobiliprotein (PBP) lyases.  PBP lyases are employed by cyanobacteria, red algae, cryptophytes and glaucophytes for light-harvesting.  Pigmentation of light-harvesting phycobiliproteins of cyanobacteria and cryptophytes requires covalent attachment of open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores, the phycobilins, to the apoproteins.  PBP lyases mediate this covalent attachment of phycobilin chromophores to apo-PBPs. These lyases are distinguishable in the clades of E/F-, S/U-, and T-type lyases; T-type lyases (which include CpcT) are distantly related to S-type lyases (which include CpcS and CpcU). S- and T-type PBP lyases differ in mechanistic details; the conformation and protonation state in which the chromophore is presented account for their differences in stereochemistry of the chromophore selectivity as well as corresponding binding sites. On the other hand, both lyases carry out the main functions of assisting site selectivity in the apo-PBP, protecting the chromophore and ensuring the regio- and stereoselectivity of the addition. The S- and T-type PBP lyases adopt a beta-barrel structure with a modified lipocalin fold.</td>
