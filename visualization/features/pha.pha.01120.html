            <td id=al>cd06173 Macrolide efflux protein A and similar proteins of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. This family is composed of Streptococcus pyogenes macrolide efflux protein A (MefA) and similar transporters, many of which remain uncharacterized. Some members may be multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters, which are drug/H+ antiporters (DHAs) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, conferring resistance to these compounds. MefA confers resistance to 14-membered macrolides including erythromycin and to 15-membered macrolides. It functions as an efflux pump to regulate intracellular macrolide levels. The MefA-like family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06174 Major Facilitator Superfamily. The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) is a large and diverse group of secondary transporters that includes uniporters, symporters, and antiporters. MFS proteins facilitate the transport across cytoplasmic or internal membranes of a variety of substrates including ions, sugar phosphates, drugs, neurotransmitters, nucleosides, amino acids, and peptides. They do so using the electrochemical potential of the transported substrates. Uniporters transport a single substrate, while symporters and antiporters transport two substrates in the same or in opposite directions, respectively, across membranes. MFS proteins are typically 400 to 600 amino acids in length, and the majority contain 12 transmembrane alpha helices (TMs) connected by hydrophilic loops. The N- and C-terminal halves of these proteins display weak similarity and may be the result of a gene duplication/fusion event. Based on kinetic studies and the structures of a few bacterial superfamily members, GlpT (glycerol-3-phosphate transporter), LacY (lactose permease), and EmrD (multidrug transporter), MFS proteins are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement. Bacterial members function primarily for nutrient uptake, and as drug-efflux pumps to confer antibiotic resistance. Some MFS proteins have medical significance in humans such as the glucose transporter Glut4, which is impaired in type II diabetes, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), which causes glycogen storage disease when mutated.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17325 bacterial MdtG-like and eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family of the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters. This family is composed of eukaryotic solute carrier 18 (SLC18) family transporters and related bacterial multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters including several proteins from Escherichia coli such as multidrug resistance protein MdtG, from Bacillus subtilis such as multidrug resistance proteins 1 (Bmr1) and 2 (Bmr2), and from Staphylococcus aureus such as quinolone resistance protein NorA. The family also includes Escherichia coli arabinose efflux transporters YfcJ and YhhS. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds. The SLC18 transporter family includes vesicular monoamine transporters (VAT1 and VAT2), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and SLC18B1, which is proposed to be a vesicular polyamine transporter (VPAT). The MdtG/SLC18 family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

This family is composed of Bacillus subtilis multidrug efflux protein YfmO, bacillibactin exporter YmfD/YmfE, uncharacterized MFS-type transporter YvmA, and similar proteins. YfmO acts to efflux copper or a copper complex, and could contribute to copper resistance. YmfD/YmfE is involved in secretion of bacillibactin. The YfmO-like family belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins, which are thought to function through a single substrate binding site, alternating-access mechanism involving a rocker-switch type of movement.</td>

NepI and PbuE are involved in the efflux of purine ribonucleosides such as guanosine, adenosine and inosine, as well as purine bases like guanine, adenine, and hypoxanthine, and purine base analogs. They play a role in the maintenance of cellular purine base pools, as well as in protecting the cells and conferring resistance against toxic purine base analogs such as 6-mercaptopurine. MDR transporters are drug/H+ antiporters (DHA) that mediate the efflux of a variety of drugs and toxic compounds, and confer resistance to these compounds.
