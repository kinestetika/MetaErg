            <td id=al>aspartate kinase. Aspartate kinase catalyzes a first step in the biosynthesis from Asp of Lys (and its precursor diaminopimelate), Met, and Thr. In E. coli, a distinct isozyme is inhibited by each of the three amino acid products. The Met-sensitive (I) and Thr-sensitive (II) forms are bifunctional enzymes fused to homoserine dehydrogenases and form homotetramers, while the Lys-sensitive form (III) is a monofunctional homodimer.The Lys-sensitive enzyme of Bacillus subtilis resembles the E. coli form but is an alpha 2/beta 2 heterotetramer, where the beta subunit is translated from an in-phase alternative initiator at Met-246. This may be a feature of a number of closely related forms, including a paralog from B. subtilis. [Amino acid biosynthesis, Aspartate family]</td>

            <td id=al>AAK_AKii-LysC-BS: Amino Acid Kinase Superfamily (AAK), AKii; this CD includes the N-terminal catalytic aspartokinase (AK) domain of the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase isoenzyme AKII of Bacillus subtilis 168, and the lysine plus threonine-sensitive aspartokinase of Corynebacterium glutamicum, and related sequences. In B. subtilis 168, the regulation of the diaminopimelate (Dap)-lysine biosynthetic pathway involves dual control by Dap and lysine, effected through separate Dap- and lysine-sensitive aspartokinase isoenzymes. The B. subtilis 168 AKII is induced by methionine, and repressed and inhibited by lysine. Although Corynebacterium glutamicum is known to contain a single aspartokinase isoenzyme type, both the succinylase and dehydrogenase variant pathways of DAP-lysine synthesis operate simultaneously in this organism. In this organism and other various Gram-positive bacteria, the DAP-lysine pathway is feedback regulated by the concerted action of lysine and theronine. Also included in this CD are the aspartokinases of the extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB27, the Gram-negative obligate methylotroph, Methylophilus methylotrophus AS1, and those single aspartokinases found in Pseudomons, C. glutamicum, and Amycolatopsis lactamdurans. B. subtilis 168 AKII, and the C. glutamicum, Streptomyces clavuligerus and A. lactamdurans aspartokinases are described as tetramers consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits; the alpha (44 kD) and beta (18 kD) subunits formed by two in-phase overlapping polypeptides.</td>

In Bacillus subtilis, the regulation of the diaminopimelate-lysine biosynthetic pathway involves dual control by diaminopimelate and lysine, effected through separate diaminopimelate- and lysine-sensitive aspartokinase isoenzymes. The role of the AKI isoenzyme is most likely to provide a constant level of aspartyl-beta-phosphate for the biosynthesis of diaminopimelate for peptidoglycan synthesis and dipicolinate during sporulation. The B. subtilis 168 AKII is induced by methionine, and repressed and inhibited by lysine. In Corynebacterium glutamicum and other various Gram-positive bacteria, the DAP-lysine pathway is feedback regulated by the concerted action of lysine and threonine. Also included in this CD are the aspartokinases of the extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB27, the Gram-negative obligate methylotroph, Methylophilus methylotrophus AS1, and those single aspartokinase isoenzyme types found in Pseudomonas, C. glutamicum, and Amycolatopsis lactamdurans. The B. subtilis AKI is tetrameric consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits; the alpha (43 kD) and beta (17 kD) subunit formed by two in-phase overlapping genes. The alpha subunit contains the AK catalytic domain and two ACT domains. The beta subunit contains two ACT domains. The B. subtilis 168 AKII aspartokinase is also described as tetrameric consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits. Some archeal aspartokinases in this group lack recognizable ACT domains.</td>

            <td id=al>aspartate kinase, monofunctional class. This model describes a subclass of aspartate kinases. These are mostly Lys-sensitive and not fused to homoserine dehydrogenase, unlike some Thr-sensitive and Met-sensitive forms. Homoserine dehydrogenase is part of Thr and Met but not Lys biosynthetic pathways. Aspartate kinase catalyzes a first step in the biosynthesis from Asp of Lys (and its precursor diaminopimelate), Met, and Thr. In E. coli, a distinct isozyme is inhibited by each of the three amino acid products. The Met-sensitive (I) and Thr-sensitive (II) forms are bifunctional enzymes fused to homoserine dehydrogenases and form homotetramers, while the Lys-sensitive form (III) is a monofunctional homodimer. The Lys-sensitive enzyme of Bacillus subtilis resembles the E. coli form but is an alpha 2/beta 2 heterotetramer, where the beta subunit is translated from an in-phase alternative initiator at Met-246. The protein slr0657 from Synechocystis PCC6803 is extended by a duplication of the C-terminal region corresponding to the beta chain. Incorporation of a second copy of the C-terminal domain may be quite common in this subgroup of aspartokinases. [Amino acid biosynthesis, Aspartate family]</td>

            <td id=al>AAK_AK: Amino Acid Kinase Superfamily (AAK), Aspartokinase (AK); this CD includes the N-terminal catalytic domain of aspartokinase (4-L-aspartate-4-phosphotransferase;). AK is the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the aspartate family of amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine) and the bacterial cell wall component, meso-diaminopimelate. It also catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and ATP to aspartylphosphate and ADP. One mechanism for the regulation of this pathway is by the production of several isoenzymes of aspartokinase with different repressors and allosteric inhibitors. Pairs of ACT domains are proposed to specifically bind amino acids leading to allosteric regulation of the enzyme. In Escherichia coli, three different aspartokinase isoenzymes are regulated specifically by lysine, methionine, and threonine. AK-HSDHI (ThrA) and AK-HSDHII (MetL) are bifunctional enzymes that consist of an N-terminal AK and a C-terminal homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDH). ThrA and MetL are involved in threonine and methionine biosynthesis, respectively. The third isoenzyme, AKIII (LysC), is monofunctional and is involved in lysine synthesis. The three Bacillus subtilis isoenzymes, AKI (DapG), AKII (LysC), and AKIII (YclM), are feedback-inhibited by meso-diaminopimelate, lysine, and lysine plus threonine, respectively. The E. coli lysine-sensitive AK is described as a homodimer, whereas, the B. subtilis lysine-sensitive AK is described as a heterodimeric complex of alpha- and beta- subunits that are formed from two in-frame overlapping genes. A single AK enzyme type has been described in Pseudomonas, Amycolatopsis, and Corynebacterium. The fungal aspartate pathway is regulated at the AK step, with L-Thr being an allosteric inhibitor of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AK (Hom3). At least two distinct AK isoenzymes can occur in higher plants, one is a monofunctional lysine-sensitive isoenzyme, which is involved in the overall regulation of the pathway and can be synergistically inhibited by S-adenosylmethionine. The other isoenzyme is a bifunctional, threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH protein. Also included in this CD is the catalytic domain of the Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum ectoine AK, the first enzyme of the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, found in this bacterium, and several other halophilic/halotolerant bacteria.</td>

In Bacillus subtilis, the regulation of the diaminopimelate-lysine biosynthetic pathway involves dual control by diaminopimelate and lysine, effected through separate diaminopimelate- and lysine-sensitive aspartokinase isoenzymes. AKI activity is invariant during the exponential and stationary phases of growth and is not altered by addition of amino acids to the growth medium. The role of this isoenzyme is most likely to provide a constant level of aspartyl-beta-phosphate for the biosynthesis of diaminopimelate for peptidoglycan synthesis and dipicolinate during sporulation. The B. subtilis AKI is tetrameric consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits; the alpha (43 kD) and beta (17 kD) subunit formed by two in-phase overlapping genes. The alpha subunit contains the AK catalytic domain and two ACT domains. The beta subunit contains two ACT domains.</td>

These aspartokinases are found in such bacteria as E. coli (AKI-HSDHI, ThrA  and  AKII-HSDHII, MetL) and in higher plants (Z. mays AK-HSDH). AK and HSDH are the first and third enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of the aspartate family of amino acids. AK catalyzes the phosphorylation of Asp to P-aspartyl phosphate. HSDH catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversion of Asp 3-semialdehyde to homoserine. ThrA and MetL are involved in threonine and methionine biosynthesis, respectively. In E. coli, ThrA is subject to allosteric regulation by the end product L-threonine and the native enzyme is reported to be tetrameric. As with bacteria, plant AK and HSDH are feedback inhibited by pathway end products. Maize AK-HSDH is a Thr-sensitive 180-kD enzyme. Arabidopsis AK-HSDH is an alanine-activated, threonine-sensitive enzyme whose ACT domains, located C-terminal to the AK catalytic domain, were shown to be involved in allosteric activation. Also included in this CD is the catalytic domain of the aspartokinase (AK) of the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase isoenzyme AKIII, a monofunctional class enzyme (LysC) found in some bacteria such as E. coli. In E. coli, LysC is reported to be a homodimer of 50 kD subunits. Also included in this CD is  the catalytic domain of aspartokinase (AK) of the bifunctional enzyme AK - DAP decarboxylase (DapDC) found in some bacteria. DapDC, which is the lysA gene product, catalyzes the decarboxylation of DAP to lysine.</td>

The exception in this group, is the inclusion of the first ACT domain of the bifunctional  aspartokinase - homoserine dehydrogenase-like enzyme group (ACT_AKi-HSDH-ThrA-like_1) which includes the  monofunctional,  threonine-sensitive, aspartokinase found  in Methanococcus jannaschii and other related archaeal species. AK catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and ATP to aspartylphosphate and ADP. AK is the first enzyme in the pathway of the biosynthesis of the aspartate family of amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine) and the bacterial cell wall component, meso-diaminopimelate. One mechanism for the regulation of this pathway is by the production of several isoenzymes of AK with different repressors and allosteric inhibitors. Pairs of ACT domains are proposed to specifically bind amino acids leading to allosteric regulation of the enzyme. In Escherichia coli (EC), three different AK isoenzymes are regulated specifically by lysine, methionine, and threonine. AK-HSDHI (ThrA) and AK-HSDHII (MetL) are bifunctional enzymes that consist of an N-terminal AK and a C-terminal homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDH). ThrA and MetL are involved in threonine and methionine biosynthesis, respectively. The third isoenzyme, AKIII (LysC), is monofunctional and is involved in lysine synthesis. The three Bacillus subtilis (BS) isoenzymes, AKI (DapG), AKII (LysC), and AKIII (YclM), are feedback inhibited by meso-diaminopimelate, lysine, and lysine plus threonine, respectively. The E. coli lysine-sensitive AK is described as a homodimer, whereas, the B. subtilis lysine-sensitive AK is described as is a heterodimeric complex of alpha- and beta- subunits that are formed from two in-frame overlapping genes. A single AK enzyme type has been described in Pseudomonas, Amycolatopsis, and Corynebacterium, and apparently, unique to cyanobacteria, are AKs with two tandem pairs of ACT domains, C-terminal to the catalytic domain. The fungal aspartate pathway is regulated at the AK step, with L-Thr being an allosteric inhibitor of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AK (Hom3). At least two distinct AK isoenzymes can occur in higher plants, a monofunctional lysine-sensitive isoenzyme, which is involved in the overall regulation of the pathway and can be synergistically inhibited by S-adenosylmethionine.

The E. coli lysine-sensitive AK is described as a homodimer, whereas, the B. subtilis lysine-sensitive AK is described as is a heterodimeric complex of alpha- and beta- subunits that are formed from two in-frame overlapping genes. A single AK enzyme type has been described in Pseudomonas, Amycolatopsis, and Corynebacterium, and apparently, unique to cyanobacteria, are aspartokinases with two tandem pairs of ACT domains, C-terminal to the catalytic domain. The fungal aspartate pathway is regulated at the AK step, with L-Thr being an allosteric inhibitor of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AK (Hom3). At least two distinct AK isoenzymes can occur in higher plants, a monofunctional lysine-sensitive isoenzyme, which is involved in the overall regulation of the pathway and can be synergistically inhibited by S-adenosylmethionine. The other isoenzyme is a bifunctional, threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH protein. Also included in this AK family CD are the ACT domains of the Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum AK; the first enzyme of the ectoine biosynthetic pathway found in this bacterium and several other halophilic/halotolerant bacteria.

            <td id=al>ACT domains C-terminal to the catalytic domain of aspartokinase (AK; 4-L-aspartate-4-phosphotransferase). This CD includes each of two ACT domains C-terminal to the catalytic domain of aspartokinase (AK; 4-L-aspartate-4-phosphotransferase). Typically, AK consists of two ACT domains in a tandem repeat, but the second ACT domain is inserted within the first, resulting in, what is normally the terminal beta strand of ACT2, formed from a region N-terminal of ACT1. AK catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and ATP to aspartylphosphate and ADP. Aspartokinase is the first enzyme in the pathway of the biosynthesis of the aspartate family of amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine) and the bacterial cell wall component, meso-diaminopimelate. One mechanism for the regulation of this pathway is by the production of several isoenzymes of aspartokinase with different repressors and allosteric inhibitors. Pairs of ACT domains are proposed to specifically bind amino acids leading to allosteric regulation of the enzyme. In Escherichia coli (EC), three different aspartokinase isoenzymes are regulated specifically by lysine, methionine, and threonine. AK-HSDHI (ThrA) and AK-HSDHII (MetL) are bifunctional enzymes that consist of an N-terminal AK and a C-terminal homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDH).
