This model describes LpxD, an enzyme for the biosynthesis of lipid A, a component oflipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane outer leaflet of most Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences are found between lipid A of different species. This protein represents the third step from UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The group added at this step generally is 14:0(3-OH) (myristate) but may vary; in Aquifex it appears to be 16:0(3-OH) (palmitate).

            <td id=al>UDP-3-O-acyl-glucosamine N-acyltransferase (LpxD): The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of 3-hydroxymyristic acid or 3-hydroxy-arachidic acid, depending on the organism, from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to UDP-3-O-acyl-glucosamine to produce UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcNAc. This constitutes the third step in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway in Gram-negative bacteria. LpxD is a homotrimer, with each subunit consisting of a novel combination of an N-terminal uridine-binding domain, a core lipid-binding left-handed parallel beta helix (LbH) domain, and a C-terminal alpha-helical extension. The LbH domain contains 9 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X).</td>

It is also essential for maintaining the integrity of the outer membrane. UDP-GlcNAc acyltransferase is a homotrimer of left-handed parallel beta helix (LbH) subunits. Each subunit contains an N-terminal LbH region with 9 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X), and a C-terminal alpha-helical region.</td>

It is a bifunctional bacterial enzyme that catalyzes two consecutive steps in the formation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an important precursor in bacterial cell wall formation. The two enzymatic activities, uridyltransferase and acetyltransferase, are carried out by two independent domains. The C-terminal LbH domain possesses the acetyltransferase activity. It catalyzes the CoA-dependent acetylation of GlcN-1-phosphate to GlcNAc-1-phosphate. The LbH domain contains 10 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X. The acetyltransferase active site is located at the interface between two subunits of the active LbH trimer.</td>

            <td id=al>sugar O-acyltransferase, sialic acid O-acetyltransferase NeuD family. This family of proteins includes the characterized NeuD sialic acid O-acetyltransferase enzymes from E. coli and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B strep). These two are quite closely related to one another, so extension of this annotation to other members of the family in unsupported without additional independent evidence. The neuD gene is often observed in close proximity to the neuABC genes for the biosynthesis of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-sialic acid), and NeuD sequences from these organisms were used to construct the seed for this model. Nevertheless, there are numerous instances of sequences identified by this model which are observed in a different genomic context (although almost universally in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis-related loci), as well as in genomes for which the biosynthesis of sialic acid (SA) is undemonstrated. Even in the cases where the association with SA biosynthesis is strong, it is unclear in the literature whether the biological substrate is SA iteself, CMP-SA, or a polymer containing SA. Similarly, it is unclear to what extent the enzyme has a preference for acetylation at the 7, 8 or 9 positions. In the absence of evidence of association with SA, members of this family may be involved with the acetylation of differring sugar substrates, or possibly the delivery of alternative acyl groups. The closest related sequences to this family (and those used to root the phylogenetic tree constructed to create this model) are believed to be succinyltransferases involved in lysine biosynthesis. These proteins contain repeats of the bacterial transferase hexapeptide (pfam00132), although often these do not register above the trusted cutoff.</td>

WcxM is thought to be bifunctional, catalyzing both the isomerization and transacetylation reactions of keto-hexoses. It contains an N-terminal LbH domain responsible for the transacetylation function and a C-terminal isomerase domain. The LbH domain contains imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X), typical of enzymes with acyltransferase activity.</td>

CAs are zinc-containing enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in a two-step mechanism, involving the nucleophilic attack of a zinc-bound hydroxide ion on carbon dioxide, followed by the regeneration of the active site by ionization of the zinc-bound water molecule and removal of a proton from the active site. They are ubiquitous enzymes involved in fundamental processes like photosynthesis, respiration, pH homeostasis and ion transport. There are three evolutionary distinct groups - alpha, beta and gamma carbonic anhydrases - which show no significant sequence identity or structural similarity. Gamma CAs are trimeric enzymes with left-handed parallel beta helix (LbH) structural domain.</td>

This reaction represents a key metabolic point of regulation for the cysteine biosynthetic pathway due to its feedback inhibition by cysteine. The enzyme is a 175 kDa homohexamer, composed of a dimer of homotrimers. Each subunit contains an N-terminal alpha helical region and a C-terminal left-handed beta-helix (LbH) subdomain with 5 turns, each containing a hexapeptide repeat motif characteristic of the acyltransferase superfamily of enzymes. The trimer interface mainly involves the C-terminal LbH subdomain while the dimer (of trimers) interface is mediated by the N-terminal alpha helical subdomain.</td>
