            <td id=al>ClC chloride channel EriC.  This domain is found in the EriC chloride transporters that mediate the extreme acid resistance response in eubacteria and archaea. This response allows bacteria to survive in the acidic environments by decarboxylation-linked proton utilization. As shown for Escherichia coli EriC, these channels can counterbalance the electric current produced by the outwardly directed virtual proton pump linked to amino acid decarboxylation.  The EriC proteins belong to the ClC superfamily of chloride ion channels, which share a unique double-barreled architecture and voltage-dependent gating mechanism.  The voltage-dependent gating is conferred by the permeating anion itself, acting as the gating charge. In Escherichia coli EriC, a glutamate residue that protrudes into the pore is thought to participate in gating by binding to a Cl- ion site within the selectivity filter.</td>

            <td id=al>Voltage gated chloride channel. This family of ion channels contains 10 or 12 transmembrane helices. Each protein forms a single pore. It has been shown that some members of this family form homodimers. In terms of primary structure, they are unrelated to known cation channels or other types of anion channels. Three ClC subfamilies are found in animals. ClC-1 is involved in setting and restoring the resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle, while other channels play important parts in solute concentration mechanisms in the kidney. These proteins contain two pfam00571 domains.</td>

            <td id=al>CLC voltage-gated chloride channel. The ClC chloride channels catalyse the selective flow of Cl- ions across cell membranes, thereby regulating electrical excitation in skeletal muscle and the flow of salt and water across epithelial barriers. This domain is found in the halogen ions (Cl-, Br- and I-) transport proteins of the ClC family.  The ClC channels are found in all three kingdoms of life and perform a variety of functions including cellular excitability regulation, cell volume regulation, membrane potential stabilization, acidification of intracellular organelles, signal transduction, transepithelial transport in animals, and the extreme acid resistance response in eubacteria.  They lack any structural or sequence similarity to other known ion channels and exhibit unique properties of ion permeation and gating.  Unlike cation-selective ion channels, which form oligomers containing a single pore along the axis of symmetry, the ClC channels form two-pore homodimers with one pore per subunit without axial symmetry.  Although lacking the typical voltage-sensor found in cation channels, all studied ClC channels are gated (opened and closed) by transmembrane voltage. The gating is conferred by the permeating ion itself, acting as the gating charge.  In addition, eukaryotic and some prokaryotic ClC channels have two additional C-terminal CBS (cystathionine beta synthase) domains of putative regulatory function.</td>

            <td id=al>The C-terminal domain of a subfamily of Na+ /H+ antiporter existed in bacteria and archea . Na+/H+ exchange proteins eject protons from cells, effectively eliminating excess acid from actively metabolising cells. Na+ /H+ exchange activity is also crucial for the regulation of cell volume, and for the reabsorption of NaCl across renal, intestinal, and other epithelia. These antiports exchange Na+ for H+ in an electroneutral manner, and this activity is carried out by a family of Na+ /H+ exchangers, or NHEs, which are known to be present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.  These exchangers are highly-regulated (glyco)phosphoproteins, which, based on their primary structure, appear to contain 10-12 membrane-spanning regions (M) at the N-terminus and a large cytoplasmic region at the C-terminus. The transmembrane regions M3-M12 share identity wit h other members of the family. The M6 and M7 regions are highly conserved. Thus, this is thought to be the region that is involved in the transport of sodium and hydrogen ions. The cytoplasmic region or C-terminal has homology with a family universal stress protein.Usp is a small cytoplasmic bacterial protein whose expression is enhanced when the cell is exposed to stress agents. Usp enhances the rate of cell survival during prolonged exposure to such conditions, and may provide a general "stress endurance" activity.</td>

            <td id=al>Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the ACT domain. The putative Acetoin Utilization Protein (Acub) from Vibrio Cholerae contains a CBS pair domain.  The acetoin utilization protein plays a role in growth and sporulation on acetoin or butanediol for use as a carbon source. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms.  It is used as an external energy store by a number of fermentive bacteria. Acetoin is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be utilised in order to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA or 2,3-butanediol is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex and acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, respectively. Acetoin utilization proteins, acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, and histone deacetylases are members of an ancient protein superfamily.This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in the acetoin utilization proteins in bacteria. Acetoin is a product of fermentative metabolism in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms.  They produce acetoin as an external carbon storage compound and then later reuse it as a carbon and energy source during their stationary phase and sporulation. In addition these CBS domains are associated with a downstream ACT (aspartate kinase/chorismate mutase/TyrA) domain, which is linked to a wide range of metabolic enzymes that are regulated by amino acid concentration. Pairs of ACT domains bind specifically to a particular amino acid leading to regulation of the linked enzyme. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>ClC-3-like chloride channel proteins.  This CD  includes ClC-3, ClC-4, ClC-5 and ClC-Y1. ClC-3 was initially cloned from rat kidney. Expression of ClC-3 produces outwardly-rectifying Cl currents that are inhibited by protein kinase C activation. It has been suggested that ClC-3 may be a ubiquitous swelling-activated Cl channel that has very similar characteristics to those of native volume-regulated Cl currents. The function of ClC-4 is unclear. Studies of human ClC-4 have revealed that it gives rise to Cl currents that rapidly activate at positive voltages, and are sensitive to extracellular pH, with currents decreasing when pH falls below 6.5. ClC-4 is broadly distributed, especially in brain and heart.   ClC-5 is predominantly expressed in the kidney, but can be found in the brain and liver. Mutations in the ClC-5 gene cause certain hereditary diseases, including Dent's disease, an X-chromosome linked syndrome characterised by proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), leading to progressive renal failure.   These proteins belong to the ClC superfamily of chloride ion channels, which share the unique double-barreled architecture and voltage-dependent gating mechanism. The gating is conferred by the permeating anion itself, acting as the gating charge.

The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

They belong to the ClC superfamily of halogen ion channels, which share a unique double-barreled architecture and voltage-dependent gating mechanism.  This superfamily lacks any structural or sequence similarity to other known ion channels and exhibit unique properties of ion permeation and gating.  The voltage-dependent gating is conferred by the permeating anion itself, acting as the gating charge.</td>

IMPDH is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the first step unique to GTP synthesis, playing a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.

The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

This cd contains 2 tandem repeats of the CBS domain in the two-component sensor histidine kinase and related-proteins. Two-component regulation is the predominant form of signal recognition and response coupling mechanism used by bacteria to sense and respond to diverse environmental stresses and cues ranging from common environmental stimuli to host signals recognized by pathogens and bacterial cell-cell communication signals.  The structures of both sensors and regulators are modular, and numerous variations in domain architecture and composition have evolved to tailor to specific needs in signal perception and signal transduction. The simplest histidine kinase sensors consists of only sensing and kinase domains.

The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

This family is part of the ClC chloride channel superfamiy. These proteins catalyse the selective flow of Cl- ions across cell membranes and Cl-/H+ exchange transport. These proteins share two characteristics that are apparently inherent to the entire ClC chloride channel superfamily: a unique double-barreled architecture and voltage-dependent gating mechanism. The gating is conferred by the permeating anion itself, acting as the gating charge.</td>

            <td id=al>Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains present in bacteria and archaea. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.

            <td id=al>Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the bacterial CAP_ED (cAMP receptor protein effector domain) family of transcription factors, the NT (Nucleotidyltransferase) Pol-beta-like domain, and the DUF294 domain. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the bacterial CAP_ED (cAMP receptor protein effector domain) family of transcription factors, the NT_Pol-beta-like domain, and the DUF294 domain.  Members of CAP_ED, include CAP which binds cAMP, FNR (fumarate and nitrate reductase) which uses an iron-sulfur cluster to sense oxygen, and CooA a heme containing CO sensor. In all cases binding of the effector leads to conformational changes and the ability to activate transcription. The NT_Pol-beta-like domain includes the Nucleotidyltransferase (NT) domains of DNA polymerase beta and other family X DNA polymerases, as well as the NT domains of class I and class II CCA-adding enzymes, RelA- and SpoT-like ppGpp synthetases and hydrolases, 2'5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A)synthetases, Escherichia coli adenylyltransferase (GlnE), Escherichia coli uridylyl transferase (GlnD), poly (A) polymerases, terminal uridylyl transferases, Staphylococcus aureus kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase, and similar proteins.  DUF294 is a putative nucleotidyltransferase with a conserved DxD motif.
