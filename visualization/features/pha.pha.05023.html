Often several members of this family are found in archaeal genomes, and the function is uncharacterized. More distantly related proteins ParA chromosome partitioning proteins.

These amidases catalyze amidations to various side chains of hydrogenobyrinic acid or cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide in the biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B12) from uroporphyrinogen III. Vitamin B12 is an important cofactor and an essential nutrient for many plants and animals and is primarily produced by bacteria.

Septum site-determining protein MinD is part of the operon MinCDE that determines the site of the formation of a septum at mid-cell, an important part of bacterial cell division. MinC is a nonspecific inhibitor of the septum protein FtsZ. MinE is the supressor of MinC. MinD plays a pivotal role, selecting the mid-cell over other sites through the activation and regulation of MinC and MinE. MinD is a membrane-associated ATPase, related to nitrogenase iron protein.</td>

            <td id=al>pfam01883 Iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein. This family has an alpha/beta topology, with 13 conserved hydrophobic residues at its core and a putative active site containing a highly conserved cysteine. Members of this family are involved in a range of physiological functions. The family includes PaaJ (PhaH) from Pseudomonas putida. PaaJ forms a complex with PaaG (PhaF), PaaI (PhaG) and PaaK (PhaI), which hydroxylates phenylacetic acid to 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. It also includes PaaD from Escherichia coli, a member of a multicomponent oxygenase involved in phenylacetyl-CoA hydroxylation. Furthermore, several members of this family are shown to be involved in iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster assembly. Iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters are inorganic co-factors that are are able to transfer electrons and act as catalysts. They are involved in diverse cellular processes including cellular respiration, DNA replication and repair, antibiotic resistance, and dinitrogen fixation. The biogenesis of such clusters from elemental iron and sulfur is an enzymatic process that requires a set of specialized proteins. Proteins containing this domain include the chloroplast protein HCF101 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 101), which has been described as an essential and specific factor for assembly of [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing protein complexes such as the membrane complex Photosystem I (PSI) and the heterodimeric FTR (ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase) complex and is involved in the assembly of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their transfer to apoproteins. The mature HCF101 protein contains an N-terminal DUF59 domain as well as eight cysteine residues along the sequence. All cysteine residues are conserved among higher plants, but of the two cysteine residues located in the DUF59 domain only Cys128 is highly conserved and is present in the highly conserved P-loop domain of the plant HCF101 (CKGGVGKS). SufT protein from Staphylococcus aureus is composed of DUF59 solely and is shown to be involved in the maturation of FeS proteins. Given all this data, it is hypothesized that DUF59 might play a role in FeS cluster assembly.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02042 partition proteins ParAB family. ParA and ParB of Caulobacter crescentus belong to a conserved family of bacterial proteins implicated in chromosome segregation. ParB binds to DNA sequences adjacent to the origin of replication and localizes to opposite cell poles shortly following the initiation of DNA replication. ParB regulates the ParA ATPase activity by promoting nucleotide exchange in a fashion reminiscent of the exchange factors of eukaryotic G proteins. ADP-bound ParA binds single-stranded DNA, whereas the ATP-bound form dissociates ParB from its DNA binding sites. Increasing the fraction of ParA-ADP in the cell inhibits cell division, suggesting that this simple nucleotide switch may regulate cytokinesis. ParA shares sequence similarity to a conserved and widespread family of ATPases which includes the repA protein of the repABC operon in Rhizobium etli symbiotic plasmid. This operon is involved in the plasmid replication and partition.</td>
