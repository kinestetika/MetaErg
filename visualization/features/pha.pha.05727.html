The two ATP-binding cassettes (BtuD) are in close contact with each other, as are the two membrane-spanning subunits (BtuC); this arrangement is distinct from that observed for the E. coli lipid flippase MsbA. The BtuC subunits provide 20 transmembrane helices grouped around a translocation pathway that is closed to the cytoplasm by a gate region, whereas the dimer arrangement of the BtuD subunits resembles the ATP-bound form of the Rad50 DNA repair enzyme. A prominent cytoplasmic loop of BtuC forms the contact region with the ATP-binding cassette and represent a conserved motif among the ABC transporters.</td>

            <td id=al>ATP-binding cassette domain of RNase L inhibitor. The ABC ATPase RNase L inhibitor (RLI) is a key enzyme in ribosomal biogenesis, formation of translation preinitiation complexes, and assembly of HIV capsids. RLI's are not transport proteins, and thus cluster with a group of soluble proteins that lack the transmembrane components commonly found in other members of the family. Structurally, RLI's have an N-terminal Fe-S domain and two nucleotide-binding domains, which are arranged to form two composite active sites in their interface cleft. RLI is one of the most conserved enzymes between archaea and eukaryotes with a sequence identity more than 48%. The high degree of evolutionary conservation suggests that RLI performs a central role in archaeal and eukaryotic physiology.</td>

            <td id=al>ATP-binding cassette domain of nickel/oligopeptides specific transporters. The ABC transporter subfamily specific for the transport of dipeptides, oligopeptides (OppD), and nickel (NikDE). The NikABCDE system of E. coli belongs to this family and is composed of the periplasmic binding protein NikA, two integral membrane components (NikB and NikC), and two ATPase (NikD and NikE). The NikABCDE transporter is synthesized under anaerobic conditions to meet the increased demand for nickel resulting from hydrogenase synthesis. The molecular mechanism of nickel uptake in many bacteria and most archaea is not known. Many other members of this ABC family are also involved in the uptake of dipeptides and oligopeptides. The oligopeptide transport system (Opp) is a five-component ABC transport composed of a membrane-anchored substrate binding proteins (SRP), OppA, two transmembrane proteins, OppB and OppC, and two ATP-binding domains, OppD and OppF.</td>
