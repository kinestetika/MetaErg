            <td id=al>cd18747 uncharacterized subgroup of the PIN_VapC4-5_FitB-like subfamily of the PIN domain superfamily. The PIN_VapC4-5_FitB-like subfamily includes the Virulence associated protein C (VapC)-like PIN (PilT N terminus) domain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis VapC4 and VapC5 ribonuclease toxins of the VapBC toxin/antitoxin (TA) system, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae FitB toxin of the FitAB TA system. This subfamily belongs to the VapC-like family of the PIN domain nuclease superfamily. VapC is the PIN-domain ribonuclease toxin from prokaryotic VapBC toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. VapB is a transcription factor-like protein antitoxin acting as an inhibitor. Other members of the VapC-like nuclease family include eukaryotic ribonucleases such as Smg6, ribosome assembly factor NOB1, exosome subunit Rrp44 endoribonuclease and rRNA-processing protein Fcf1. The structural properties of the PIN (PilT N terminus) domain indicate its active center, consisting of three highly conserved catalytic residues which coordinate metal ions, in some members, additional metal coordinating residues can be found. Some members of the superfamily lack several of these key catalytic residues. The PIN active site is geometrically similar in the active center of structure-specific 5' nucleases, PIN-domain ribonucleases of eukaryotic rRNA editing proteins, and bacterial toxins of toxin-antitoxin (TA) operons.</td>

            <td id=al>cd18731 VapC-like PIN domain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae FitB and related proteins. This subfamily includes the Virulence associated protein C (VapC)-like PIN (PilT N terminus) domain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae FitB toxin of the FitAB toxin/antitoxin (TA) system. This subfamily belongs to the VapC-like family of the PIN domain nuclease superfamily. VapC is the PIN-domain ribonuclease toxin from prokaryotic VapBC toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. VapB is a transcription factor-like protein antitoxin acting as an inhibitor. In N. gonorrhoeae, FitA and FitB form a heterodimer: FitA is the DNA binding subunit and FitB contains a ribonuclease activity that is blocked by the presence of FitA. A tetramer of FitAB heterodimers binds DNA from the fitAB upstream promoter region with high affinity. This results in both sequestration of FitAB and repression of fitAB transcription. It is thought that FitAB release from the DNA and subsequent dissociation both slows N. gonorrhoeae replication and transcytosis by an as yet undefined mechanism. The toxin M. tuberculosis VapC is a structural homolog of N. gonorrhoeae FitB, but their antitoxin partners, VapB and FitA, respectively, differ structurally. The structural properties of the PIN (PilT N terminus) domain indicate its active center, consisting of three highly conserved catalytic residues which coordinate metal ions, in some members, additional metal coordinating residues can be found. Some members of the superfamily lack several of these key catalytic residues. The PIN active site is geometrically similar in the active center of structure-specific 5' nucleases, PIN-domain ribonucleases of eukaryotic rRNA editing proteins, and bacterial toxins of toxin-antitoxin (TA) operons.</td>

            <td id=al>cd09875 VapC-like PIN domain of ribonucleases (toxins), VapC and FitB, of prokaryotic toxin/antitoxin operons, Pyrococcus horikoshii protein PH0500, and other similar bacterial and archaeal homologs. PIN (PilT N terminus) domain-containing proteins of prokaryotic toxin/antitoxin (TA) operons, such as, Mycobacterium tuberculosis VapC of the VapBC (virulence associated proteins) TA operon, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae FitB of the FitAB (fast intracellular trafficking) TA operon, as well as, the archaeal Pyrococcus horikoshii protein PH0500 are included in this family. Toxins of TA operons are believed to be involved in growth inhibition by regulating translation and are nearly always co-expressed with an antitoxin, a cognate protein inhibitor, forming an inert protein complex. Disassociation of the complex activates the ribonuclease activity of the toxin. In N. gonorrhoeae, FitA and FitB form a heterodimer: FitA is the DNA binding subunit and FitB contains a ribonuclease activity that is blocked by the presence of FitA. A tetramer of FitAB heterodimers binds DNA from the fitAB upstream promoter region with high affinity. This results in both sequestration of FitAB and repression of fitAB transcription. It is thought that FitAB release from the DNA and subsequent dissociation both slows N. gonorrhoeae replication and transcytosis by an as yet undefined mechanism. The toxin M. tuberculosis VapC is a structural homolog of N. gonorrhoeae FitB, but their antitoxin partners, VapB and FitA, respectively, differ structurally. The M. tuberculosis VapC-5 is proposed to be both an endoribonuclease and an exoribonuclease that can act on free RNA in a similar manner to the endo and exonuclease Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1). VapC-like toxins are structural homologs of FEN1-like PIN domains, but lack the extensive arch/clamp region and the H3TH (helix-3-turn-helix) domain, an atypical helix-hairpin-helix-2-like region, seen in FEN1-like PIN domains. PIN domains within this group typically contain three or four conserved acidic residues that cluster at the C-terminal end of the beta-sheet and form a negatively charged pocket near the center of the molecule. These putative active site residues are thought to bind Mg2+ and/or Mn2+ ions and be essential for single-stranded ribonuclease activity. VapC-like PIN domains are single domain proteins that form dimers and dimerization configures the active sites in a groove along the long-axis of the structure.</td>
