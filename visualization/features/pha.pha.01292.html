            <td id=al>cd00401 S-Adenosylhomocysteine Hydrolase, NAD-binding and catalytic domains. S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH, AdoHycase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHyc) to form adenosine (Ado) and homocysteine (Hcy). The equilibrium lies far on the side of AdoHyc synthesis, but in nature the removal of Ado and Hyc is sufficiently fast, so that the net reaction is in the direction of hydrolysis. Since AdoHyc is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methyltransferases, AdoHycase plays a critical role in the modulation of the activity of various methyltransferases. The enzyme forms homotetramers, with each monomer binding one molecule of NAD+.</td>

            <td id=al>cd12154 Formate/glycerate dehydrogenases, D-specific 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases and related dehydrogenases. The formate/glycerate dehydrogenase like family contains a diverse group of enzymes such as formate dehydrogenase (FDH), glycerate dehydrogenase (GDH), D-lactate dehydrogenase, L-alanine dehydrogenase, and S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, that share a common 2-domain structure. Despite often low sequence identity, these proteins typically have a characteristic arrangement of 2 similar domains of the alpha/beta Rossmann fold NAD+ binding form. The NAD(P) binding domain is inserted within the linear sequence of the mostly N-terminal catalytic domain. Structurally, these domains are connected by extended alpha helices and create a cleft in which NAD(P) is bound, primarily to the C-terminal portion of the 2nd (internal) domain. While many members of this family are dimeric, alanine DH is hexameric and phosphoglycerate DH is tetrameric. 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the conversion of a wide variety of D-2-hydroxy acids to their corresponding keto acids. The general mechanism is (R)-lactate + acceptor to pyruvate + reduced acceptor. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of formate ion to carbon dioxide with the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. FDHs of this family contain no metal ions or prosthetic groups. Catalysis occurs though direct transfer of a hydride ion to NAD+ without the stages of acid-base catalysis typically found in related dehydrogenases.</td>

Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases (PGDHs) catalyze the initial step in the biosynthesis of L-serine from D-3-phosphoglycerate. PGDHs come in 3 distinct structural forms, with this first group being related to 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases, sharing structural similarity to formate and glycerate dehydrogenases of the D-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase superfamily, which also include groups such as L-alanine dehydrogenase and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. Despite often low sequence identity, these proteins typically have a characteristic arrangement of 2 similar subdomains of the alpha/beta Rossmann fold NAD+ binding form. The NAD+ binding domain is inserted within the linear sequence of the mostly N-terminal catalytic domain, which has a similar domain structure to the internal NAD binding domain. Structurally, these domains are connected by extended alpha helices and create a cleft in which NAD is bound, primarily to the C-terminal portion of the 2nd (internal) domain. Some related proteins have similar structural subdomain but with a tandem arrangement of the catalytic and NAD-binding subdomains in the linear sequence. Many, not all, members of this family are dimeric.</td>
