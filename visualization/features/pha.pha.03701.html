            <td id=al>cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily. Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) is a large superfamily of heme-containing proteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions of a large number of structurally different endogenous and exogenous compounds in organisms from all major domains of life. CYPs with > 40% sequence identity are members of the same family. There are approximately 2250 CYP families: mammals, insects, plants, fungi, bacteria, and archaea have around 18, 208, 277, 805, 591, and 14 families, respectively. CYPs bind their diverse ligands in a buried, hydrophobic active site, which is accessed through a substrate access channel formed by two flexible helices and their connecting loop. Their monooxygenase activity relies on the reductive scission of molecular oxygen bound to the P450 heme iron, and the delivery of two electrons to the heme iron during the catalytic cycle. CYPs use a variety of redox partners, such as the eukaryotic diflavin enzyme NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and the bacterial/mitochondrial NAD(P)H-ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin partners. Some CYPs are naturally linked to their redox partners and others have evolved to bypass requirements for redox partners, and instead react directly with hydrogen peroxide or NAD(P)H to facilitate oxidative or reductive catalysis.</td>

            <td id=al>Cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds. They are particularly well known for their role in the degradation of environmental toxins and mutagens. They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyze regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures.</td>

It is a dual enzyme that catalyzes both the 17-alpha-hydroxylation and the 17,20-lyase reactions.

            <td id=al>cytochrome P450 family 7, subfamily A, polypeptide 1. Cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) is also called cholesterol 7-alpha-monooxygenase (EC 1.14.14.23) or cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase. It catalyzes the hydroxylation at position 7 of cholesterol, a rate-limiting step in the classic (or neutral) pathway of cholesterol catabolism and bile acid biosynthesis. It is important for cholesterol homeostasis. CYP7A1 belongs to the large cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) superfamily of heme-containing proteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions of a large number of structurally different endogenous and exogenous compounds in organisms from all major domains of life. CYPs bind their diverse ligands in a buried, hydrophobic active site, which is accessed through a substrate access channel formed by two flexible helices and their connecting loop.</td>

            <td id=al>unknown subfamily of actinobacterial cytochrome P450s. This subfamily is composed of uncharacterized cytochrome P450s. Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) is a large superfamily of heme-containing proteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions of a large number of structurally different endogenous and exogenous compounds in organisms from all major domains of life. CYPs bind their diverse ligands in a buried, hydrophobic active site, which is accessed through a substrate access channel formed by two flexible helices and their connecting loop. Their monooxygenase activity relies on the reductive scission of molecular oxygen bound to the P450 heme iron, and the delivery of two electrons to the heme iron during the catalytic cycle.</td>

            <td id=al>cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily B. The human cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily B (CYP2B) consists of only one functional member CYP2B6, which shows broad substrate specificity and plays a key role in the metabolism of many clinical drugs, environmental toxins, and endogenous compounds. Rodents have multiple functional CYP2B proteins; mouse subfamily members include CYP2B9, 2B10, 2B13, 2B19, and 2B23. CYP2B enzymes are highly inducible by chemicals that interact with the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and/or pregnane X receptor (PXR), such as rifampicin and phenobarbital. The CYP2B subfamily belongs to the large cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) superfamily of heme-containing proteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions of a large number of structurally different endogenous and exogenous compounds in organisms from all major domains of life. CYPs bind their diverse ligands in a buried, hydrophobic active site, which is accessed through a substrate access channel formed by two flexible helices and their connecting loop.</td>

            <td id=al>cytochrome P450 family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 and similar cytochrome P450s. Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is expressed in liver and extrahepatic tissues where it carries out the metabolism of numerous xenobiotics, including metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It is also important in regulating endogenous metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of steroid hormones, fatty acids, melatonin, and vitamins. CYP1B1 is overexpressed in a wide variety of tumors and is associated with angiogenesis. It is also associated with adipogenesis, obesity, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. It is therefore a target for the treatment of metabolic diseases and cancer. Also included in this subfamily are CYP1C proteins from fish, birds and amphibians. The CYP1B1-like subfamily belongs to the large cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) superfamily of heme-containing proteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions of a large number of structurally different endogenous and exogenous compounds in organisms from all major domains of life. CYPs bind their diverse ligands in a buried, hydrophobic active site, which is accessed through a substrate access channel formed by two flexible helices and their connecting loop.</td>

            <td id=al>cytochrome P450 family 74. The cytochrome P450 74 (CYP74) family controls several enzymatic conversions of fatty acid hydroperoxides to bioactive oxylipins in plants, some invertebrates, and bacteria. It includes two dehydrases, namely allene oxide synthase (AOS) and divinyl ether synthase (DES), and two isomerases, hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) and epoxyalcohol synthase (EAS). AOS (EC 4.2.1.92, also called hydroperoxide dehydratase), such as Arabidopsis thaliana CYP74A acts on a number of unsaturated fatty-acid hydroperoxides, forming the corresponding allene oxides. DES (EC 4.2.1.121), also called colneleate synthase or CYP74D, catalyzes the selective removal of pro-R hydrogen at C-8 in the biosynthesis of colneleic acid. The linolenate HPL, Arabidopsis thaliana CYP74B2, is required for the synthesis of the green leaf volatiles (GLVs) hexanal and trans-2-hexenal. The fatty acid HPL, Solanum lycopersicum CYP74B, is involved in the biosynthesis of traumatin and C6 aldehydes. The epoxyalcohol synthase Ranunculus japonicus CYP74A88 (also known as RjEAS) specifically converts linoleic acid 9- and 13-hydroperoxides to oxiranyl carbinols 9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid and 11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, respectively. The CYP74 family belongs to the large cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) superfamily of heme-containing proteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions of a large number of structurally different endogenous and exogenous compounds in organisms from all major domains of life. CYPs bind their diverse ligands in a buried, hydrophobic active site, which is accessed through a substrate access channel formed by two flexible helices and their connecting loop.</td>
