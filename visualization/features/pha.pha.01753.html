            <td id=al>3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, large subunit. Members of this family are 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, large subunit, or the large subunit domain of single-chain forms. Homoaconitase, aconitase, and 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase have similar overall structures. All are dehydratases (EC 4.2.1.-) and bind a Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster. 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase is split into large (leuC) and small (leuD) chains in eubacteria. Several pairs of archaeal proteins resemble the leuC and leuD pair in length and sequence but even more closely resemble the respective domains of homoaconitase, and their identity is uncertain. These homologs are now described by a separate model of subfamily (rather than equivalog) homology type, and the priors and cutoffs for this model have been changed to focus this equivalog family more narrowly.

            <td id=al>homoaconitate hydratase family protein. This model represents a subfamily of proteins consisting of aconitase, homoaconitase, 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, and uncharacterized proteins. The majority of the members of this family have been designated as 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase large subunit (LeuC) in microbial genome annotation, but the only characterized member is Thermus thermophilus homoaconitase, an enzyme of a non-aspartate pathway of Lys biosynthesis.</td>

This subfamily is a subset of the larger HacA family (Homoaconitate hydratase family, TIGR01343) and is most closely related to the 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase, large subunits which form TIGR00170. This subfamily includes the members of TIGR01343 which are gene clustered with other genes of leucine biosynthesis. The rest of the subfamily includes mainly archaeal species which exhibit two hits to this model. In these cases it is possible that one or the other of the hits does not have a 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase activity but rather one of the other related aconitase-like activities.</td>

            <td id=al>Aconitase catalytic domain; Aconitase catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate and isocitrate as part of the TCA cycle. Aconitase catalytic domain. Aconitase (aconitate hydratase) catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate and isocitrate as part of the TCA cycle.  Cis-aconitate is formed as an intermediate product during the course of the reaction. In eukaryotes two isozymes of aconitase are known to exist: one found in the mitochondrial matrix and the other found in the cytoplasm. Aconitase, in its active form, contains a 4Fe-4S  iron-sulfur cluster; three cysteine residues have been shown to be ligands of the 4Fe-4S cluster. This is the Aconitase core domain, including structural domains 1, 2 and 3, which binds the Fe-S cluster. The aconitase family also contains the following proteins: - Iron-responsive  element binding protein (IRE-BP), a cytosolic protein that binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs). IREs are stem-loop structures found in  the 5'UTR of ferritin, and delta aminolevulinic acid synthase mRNAs, and in the 3'UTR of  transferrin receptor mRNA. IRE-BP also express aconitase activity. - 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (isopropylmalate isomerase), the enzyme that catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of leucine. - Homoaconitase (homoaconitate hydratase), an enzyme that participates in the  alpha-aminoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis and that converts cis-homoaconitate into homoisocitric acid.</td>

The active cluster is part of the catalytic site that interconverts citrate, cis-aconitase and isocitrate. The domain architecture of aconitase B is different from other aconitases in that the catalytic domain is normally found at C-terminus for other aconitases, but it is at N-terminus for B family. It also has a HEAT domain before domain 4 which plays a role in protein-protein interaction. This alignment is the core domain including domains 1,2 and 3.</td>
