Met-tRNA-FMT transfers a formyl group from N-10 formyltetrahydrofolate to the amino terminal end of a methionyl-aminoacyl-tRNA acyl moiety, yielding formyl-Met-tRNA. Formyl-Met-tRNA plays essential role in protein translation initiation by forming complex with IF2. The formyl group plays a dual role in the initiator identity of N-formylmethionyl-tRNA by promoting its recognition by IF2 and by impairing its binding to EFTU-GTP.  The N-terminal domain contains a Rossmann fold and it is the catalytic domain of the enzyme.</td>

The mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferases are so divergent that, in a multiple alignment of bacterial fmt, mitochondrial fmt, and formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenases, the mitochondrial fmt appears the most different. However, because both bacterial and mitochondrial fmt are included in the seed alignment, all credible fmt sequences score higher than any non-fmt sequence. This enzyme modifies Met on initiator tRNA to f-Met. [Protein synthesis, tRNA aminoacylation]</td>

ArnA_N:  ArnA is a bifunctional enzyme required for the modification of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (Ara4N) that leads to resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and clinical antimicrobials such as polymyxin.  The C-terminal dehydrogenase domain of ArnA catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) to UDP-4-keto-arabinose (UDP-Ara4O), while the N-terminal formyltransferase domain of ArnA catalyzes the addition of a formyl group to UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (UDP-L-Ara4N) to form UDP-L-4-formamido-arabinose (UDP-L-Ara4FN). This domain family represents the catalytic core of the N-terminal formyltransferase domain. The formyltransferase also contains a smaller C-terminal domain the may be  involved in substrate binding. ArnA forms a hexameric structure, in which the dehydrogenase domains are arranged at the center of the particle with the transformylase domains on the outside of the particle.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08369 Formyltransferase, catalytic core domain. Formyltransferase, catalytic core domain. The proteins of this superfamily contain a formyltransferase domain that hydrolyzes the removal of a formyl group from its substrate as part of a multistep transfer mechanism, and this alignment model represents the catalytic core of the formyltransferase domain.  This family includes the following known members; Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase (GART), Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase, Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase, ArnA, and 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (FDH).  Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase  (GART) catalyzes the third step in de novo purine biosynthesis, the transfer of a formyl group to 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide. Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-FH4) to FH4 and formate. Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase transfers a formyl group onto the amino terminus of the acyl moiety of the methionyl aminoacyl-tRNA, which plays important role in translation initiation. ArnA is required for the modification of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (Ara4N) that leads to resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) and clinical antimicrobials such as polymyxin. 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, a precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis, to tetrahydrofolate. Members of this family are multidomain proteins. The formyltransferase domain is located at the N-terminus of FDH, Methionyl-tRNA Formyltransferase and ArnA, and at the C-terminus of Formyl-FH4 Hydrolase.  Prokaryotic Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase (GART) is a single domain protein while eukaryotic GART is a trifunctional protein that catalyzes the second, third and fifth steps in de novo purine biosynthesis.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08647 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH), N-terminal hydrolase domain. This family represents the N-terminal hydrolase domain of the bifunctional protein 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH). This domain contains a 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF) binding site and shares sequence homology and structural topology with other enzymes utilizing this substrate. This domain functions as a hydrolase, catalyzing the conversion of 10-formyl-THF, a precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis, to tetrahydrofolate (THF). The overall FDH reaction mechanism is a coupling of two sequential reactions, a hydrolase and a formyl dehydrogenase, bridged by a substrate transfer step.  The N-terminal hydrolase domain removes the formyl group from 10-formyl-THF and the C-terminal NADP-dependent dehydrogenase domain then reduces the formyl group to carbon dioxide.  The two catalytic domains are connected by a third intermediate linker domain that transfers the formyl group, covalently attached to the sulfhydryl group of the phosphopantetheine arm, from the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal domain.</td>

Proteins found in this family include methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase, ArnA, and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferases constitute the majority of the family and also demonstrate greater sequence diversity. Although most proteins with formyltransferase activity contain the C-terminal domain, some formyltransferases ( for example, prokaryotic glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GART)) only have the core catalytic domain, indicating that the C-terminal domain is not a requirement for catalytic activity and may be involved in substrate binding. For example, the C-terminal domain of methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase is involved in the tRNA binding.</td>

In Streptomyces albus a member of this family has been shown to be involved in the synthesis of oxazolomycin (OZM). OZM is a hybrid peptide-polyketide antibiotic and exhibits potent antitumor and antiviral activities. It is a multi-domain protein consisting of a formyl transferase domain, a Flavin-utilizing monoxygenase domain, a LuxE domain functioning as an acyl protein synthetase and a pp-binding domain, which may function as an acyl carrier. It shows sequence similarity with other peptide-polyketide biosynthesis proteins.</td>
