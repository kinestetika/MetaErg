            <td id=al>smart01004 Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. This entry represents porphobilinogen (PBG) synthase (PBGS, or 5-aminoaevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD, ), which functions during the second stage of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyses a Knorr-type condensation reaction between two molecules of ALA to generate porphobilinogen, the pyrrolic building block used in later steps. The structure of the enzyme is based on a TIM barrel topology made up of eight identical subunits, where each subunit binds to a metal ion that is essential for activity, usually zinc (in yeast, mammals and certain bacteria) or magnesium (in plants and other bacteria). A lysine has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism. The lack of PBGS enzyme causes a rare porphyric disorder known as ALAD porphyria, which appears to involve conformational changes in the enzyme.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04823 Porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS), which is also called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), catalyzes the condensation of two 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) molecules to form the pyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG), which is the second step in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles, such as heme, vitamin B12 and chlorophyll. This reaction involves the formation of a Schiff base link between the substrate and the enzyme. PBGSs are metalloenzymes, some of which have a second, allosteric metal binding site, beside the metal ion binding site in their active site. Although PBGS is a family of homologous enzymes, its metal ion utilization at catalytic site varies between zinc and magnesium and/or potassium. PBGS can be classified into two groups based on differences in their active site metal binding site. All of PBGS_aspartate_rich contain an aspartate rich metal binding site with the general sequence DXALDX(Y/F)X3G(H/Q)DG. They also contain an allosteric magnesium binding sequence RX~164DX~65EXXXD and are activated by magnesium and/or potassium, but not by zinc. PBGSs_aspartate_rich are found in some bacterial species and photosynthetic organisms such as vascular plants, mosses and algae, but not in archaea.</td>

Although PBGS is a family of homologous enzymes, its metal ion utilization at catalytic site varies between zinc and magnesium and/or potassium. PBGS can be classified into two groups based on differences in their active site metal binding site. They either contain a cysteine-rich zinc binding site (consensus DXCXCX(Y/F)X3G(H/Q)CG) or an aspartate-rich magnesium binding site (consensus DXALDX(Y/F)X3G(H/Q)DG). The cysteine-rich zinc binding site appears more common. Most members represented by this model also have a second allosteric magnesium binding site (consensus RX~164DX~65EXXXD, missing in a eukaryotic subfamily with cysteine-rich zinc binding site).</td>
