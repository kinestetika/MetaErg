            <td id=al>cd11333 Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in Sucrose isomerases, oligo-1,6-glucosidase (also called isomaltase; sucrase-isomaltase; alpha-limit dextrinase), dextran glucosidase (also called glucan 1,6-alpha-glucosidase), and related proteins. The sucrose isomerases (SIs) Isomaltulose synthase (EC 5.4.99.11) and Trehalose synthase (EC 5.4.99.16) catalyze the isomerization of sucrose and maltose to produce isomaltulose and trehalulose, respectively. Oligo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.10) hydrolyzes the alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkage of isomaltooligosaccharides, pannose, and dextran. Unlike alpha-1,4-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.20), it fails to hydrolyze the alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds of maltosaccharides. Dextran glucosidase (DGase, EC 3.2.1.70) hydrolyzes alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages at the non-reducing end of panose, isomaltooligosaccharides and dextran to produce alpha-glucose.The common reaction chemistry of the alpha-amylase family enzymes is based on a two-step acid catalytic mechanism that requires two critical carboxylates: one acting as a general acid/base (Glu) and the other as a nucleophile (Asp). Both hydrolysis and transglycosylation proceed via the nucleophilic substitution reaction between the anomeric carbon, C1 and a nucleophile. Both enzymes contain the three catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) common to the alpha-amylase family as well as two histidine residues which are predicted to be critical to binding the glucose residue adjacent to the scissile bond in the substrates. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.</td>

Maltase (EC 3.2.1.20) hydrolyzes the terminal, non-reducing (1->4)-linked alpha-D-glucose residues in maltose, releasing alpha-D-glucose. In most cases, maltase is equivalent to alpha-glucosidase, but the term "maltase" emphasizes the disaccharide nature of the substrate from which glucose is cleaved, and the term "alpha-glucosidase" emphasizes the bond, whether the substrate is a disaccharide or polysaccharide.

The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The catalytic triad (DED) is not present here. The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd11320 Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in maltogenic amylases, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, and related proteins. Enzymes such as amylases, cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase), and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) degrade starch to smaller oligosaccharides by hydrolyzing the alpha-D-(1,4) linkages between glucose residues. In the case of CGTases, an additional cyclization reaction is catalyzed yielding mixtures of cyclic oligosaccharides which are referred to as alpha-, beta-, or gamma-cyclodextrins (CDs), consisting of six, seven, or eight glucose residues, respectively. CGTases are characterized depending on the major product of the cyclization reaction. Besides having similar catalytic site residues, amylases and CGTases contain carbohydrate binding domains that are distant from the active site and are implicated in attaching the enzyme to raw starch granules and in guiding the amylose chain into the active site. The maltogenic alpha-amylase from Bacillus is a five-domain structure, unlike most alpha-amylases, but similar to that of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase. In addition to the A, B, and C domains, they have a domain D and a starch-binding domain E. Maltogenic amylase is an endo-acting amylase that has activity on cyclodextrins, terminally modified linear maltodextrins, and amylose.

Amylosucrase is a glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a D-glucopyranosyl moiety from sucrose onto an acceptor molecule. When the acceptor is another saccharide, only alpha-1,4 linkages are produced. Unlike most amylopolysaccharide synthases, it does not require any alpha-D-glucosyl nucleoside diphosphate substrate. In the presence of glycogen it catalyzes the transfer of a D-glucose moiety onto a glycogen branch, but in its absence, it hydrolyzes sucrose and synthesizes polymers, smaller maltosaccharides, and sucrose isoforms.

            <td id=al>cd11325 Alpha amylase catalytic domain found in Glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (also called Maltooligosyl trehalose Trehalohydrolase). Glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (GTHase) was discovered as part of a coupled system for the production of trehalose from soluble starch. In the first half of the reaction, glycosyltrehalose synthase (GTSase), an intramolecular glycosyl transferase, converts the glycosidic bond between the last two glucose residues of amylose from an alpha-1,4 bond to an alpha-1,1 bond, making a non-reducing glycosyl trehaloside. In the second half of the reaction, GTHase cleaves the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond adjacent to the trehalose moiety to release trehalose and malto-oligosaccharide. Like isoamylase and other glycosidases that recognize branched oligosaccharides, GTHase contains an N-terminal extension and does not have the conserved calcium ion present in other alpha amylase family enzymes. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides.
