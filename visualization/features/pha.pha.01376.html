Desulfobacterium autotrophicum LeuA3 is sequence-similar to alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA) but its exact function is unknown.  Members of this family have an N-terminal TIM barrel domain that belongs to the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily.  DRE-TIM metallolyases include 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS), alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (LeuA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, homocitrate synthase, citramalate synthase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, re-citrate synthase, transcarboxylase 5S, pyruvate carboxylase, AksA, and FrbC.  These members all share a conserved  triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain consisting of a core beta(8)-alpha(8) motif with the eight parallel beta strands forming an enclosed barrel surrounded by eight alpha helices.  The domain has a catalytic center containing a divalent cation-binding site formed by a cluster of invariant residues that cap the core of the barrel.  In addition, the catalytic site includes three invariant residues - an aspartate (D), an arginine (R), and a glutamate (E) - which is the basis for the domain name "DRE-TIM".</td>

This family includes the Arabidopsis thaliana IPMS1 and IPMS2 proteins, the Glycine max GmN56 protein, and the Brassica insularis BatIMS protein.  This family also includes a group of archeal IPMS-like proteins represented by the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii AksA protein.  AksA catalyzes the condensation of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetyl-CoA to form trans-homoaconitate, one of 13 steps in the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylCoA to alpha-ketosuberate, a precursor to coenzyme B and biotin.  AksA also catalyzes the condensation of alpha-ketoadipate or alpha-ketopimelate with acetylCoA to form, respectively, the (R)-homocitrate homologs (R)-2-hydroxy-1,2,5-pentanetricarboxylic acid and (R)-2-hydroxy-1,2,6- hexanetricarboxylic acid.

It comprises two similar units that are arranged such that the two -helices pack together in the centre, crossing at an angle of 34 degrees, sandwiched between the two three-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheets.

            <td id=al>cd07939 Streptomyces rubellomurinus FrbC and related proteins, catalytic TIM barrel domain. FrbC (NifV) of Streptomyces rubellomurinus catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and alpha-ketoglutarate to form homocitrate and CoA, a reaction similar to one catalyzed by homocitrate synthase.  The gene encoding FrbC is one of several genes required for the biosynthesis of FR900098, a potent antimalarial antibiotic.  This protein is also required for assembly of the nitrogenase MoFe complex but its exact role is unknown.
