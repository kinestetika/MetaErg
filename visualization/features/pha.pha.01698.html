            <td id=al>cd03017 Peroxiredoxin (PRX) family, Bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP) subfamily; composed of  thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidases, widely expressed in pathogenic bacteria, that protect cells against toxicity from reactive oxygen species by reducing and detoxifying hydroperoxides. The protein was named BCP based on its electrophoretic mobility before its function was known. BCP shows substrate selectivity toward fatty acid hydroperoxides rather than hydrogen peroxide or alkyl hydroperoxides. BCP contains the peroxidatic cysteine but appears not to possess a resolving cysteine (some sequences, not all, contain a second cysteine but its role is still unknown). Unlike other PRXs, BCP exists as a monomer. The plant homolog of BCP is PRX Q, which is expressed only in leaves and is cellularly localized in the chloroplasts and the guard cells of stomata. Also included in this subfamily is the fungal nuclear protein,  Dot5p (for disrupter of telomere silencing protein 5), which functions as an alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase during post-diauxic growth.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03018 Peroxiredoxin (PRX) family, AhpE-like subfamily; composed of proteins similar to Mycobacterium tuberculosis AhpE. AhpE is described as a 1-cys PRX because of the absence of a resolving cysteine. The structure and sequence of AhpE, however, show greater similarity to 2-cys PRXs than 1-cys PRXs. PRXs are thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins that confer a protective role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either thioredoxin, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF. The first step of catalysis is the nucleophilic attack by the peroxidatic cysteine on the peroxide leading to the formation of a cysteine sulfenic acid intermediate. The absence of a resolving cysteine suggests that functional AhpE is regenerated by an external reductant. The solution behavior and crystal structure of AhpE show that it forms dimers and octamers.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02971 Peroxiredoxin (PRX) family; composed of the different classes of PRXs including many proteins originally known as bacterioferritin comigratory proteins (BCP), based on their electrophoretic mobility before their function was identified. PRXs are thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) proteins also known as TRX peroxidases and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C22 (AhpC) proteins. They confer a protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either TRX, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF. They are distinct from other peroxidases in that they have no cofactors such as metals or prosthetic groups. The first step of catalysis, common to all PRXs, is the nucleophilic attack by the catalytic cysteine (also known as the peroxidatic cysteine) on the peroxide leading to cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond and the formation of a cysteine sulfenic acid intermediate. The second step of the reaction, the resolution of the intermediate, distinguishes the different types of PRXs. The presence or absence of a second cysteine (the resolving cysteine) classifies PRXs as either belonging to the 2-cys or 1-cys type. The resolving cysteine of 2-cys PRXs is either on the same chain (atypical) or on the second chain (typical) of a functional homodimer. Structural and motif analysis of this growing family supports the need for a new classification system. The peroxidase activity of PRXs is regulated in vivo by irreversible cysteine over-oxidation into a sulfinic acid, phosphorylation and limited proteolysis.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02966 TlpA-like family; composed of  TlpA, ResA, DsbE and similar proteins. TlpA, ResA and DsbE are bacterial protein disulfide reductases with important roles in cytochrome maturation. They are membrane-anchored proteins with a soluble TRX domain containing a CXXC motif located in the periplasm. The TRX domains of this family contain an insert, approximately 25 residues in length, which correspond to an extra alpha helix and a beta strand when compared with TRX. TlpA catalyzes an essential reaction in the biogenesis of cytochrome aa3, while ResA and DsbE are essential proteins in cytochrome c maturation. Also included in this family are proteins containing a TlpA-like TRX domain with domain architectures similar to E. coli DipZ protein, and the N-terminal TRX domain of PilB protein from Neisseria which acts as a disulfide reductase that can recylce methionine sulfoxide reductases.</td>

The second cysteine in the motif corresponds to the peroxidatic cysteine of PRX, however, these proteins do not contain the other two residues of the catalytic triad of PRX. PRXs confer a protective antioxidant role in cells through their peroxidase activity in which hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrate, and organic hydroperoxides are reduced and detoxified using reducing equivalents derived from either thioredoxin, glutathione, trypanothione and AhpF. TRXs alter the redox state of target proteins by catalyzing the reduction of their disulfide bonds via the CXXC motif using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins.</td>
