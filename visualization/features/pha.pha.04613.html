            <td id=al>Peptidase S8 family domain, uncharacterized subfamily 2. This family is a member of the Peptidases S8 or Subtilases serine endo- and exo-peptidase clan. They have an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. The stability of subtilases may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity. Some members of this clan contain disulfide bonds. These enzymes can be intra- and extracellular, some function at extreme temperatures and pH values.</td>

            <td id=al>Subtilase family. Subtilases are a family of serine proteases. They appear to have independently and convergently evolved an Asp/Ser/His catalytic triad, like that found in the trypsin serine proteases (see pfam00089). Structure is an alpha/beta fold containing a 7-stranded parallel beta sheet, order 2314567.</td>

            <td id=al>Peptidase S8 family domain in Vpr-like proteins. The maturation of the peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic) subtilin in Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 includes posttranslational modifications of the propeptide and proteolytic cleavage of the leader peptide.  Vpr was identified as one of the proteases,  along with WprA, that are capable of processing subtilin.    Asp, Ser, His triadPeptidases S8 or Subtilases are a serine endo- and exo-peptidase clan.

            <td id=al>Peptidase domain in the S8 and S53 families. Members of the peptidases S8 (subtilisin and kexin) and S53 (sedolisin) family include endopeptidases and  exopeptidases. The S8 family has an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. Serine acts as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base. The S53 family contains a catalytic triad Glu/Asp/Ser with an additional acidic residue Asp in the oxyanion hole, similar to that of subtilisin.  The serine residue here is the nucleophilic equivalent of the serine residue in the S8 family, while glutamic acid has the same role here as the histidine base.   However, the aspartic acid residue that acts as an electrophile is quite different.  In S53, it follows glutamic acid, while in S8 it precedes histidine. The stability of these enzymes may be enhanced by calcium; some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity.  There is a great diversity in the characteristics of their members: some contain disulfide bonds, some are intracellular while others are extracellular, some function at extreme temperatures, and others at high or low pH values.</td>
