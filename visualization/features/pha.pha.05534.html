            <td id=al>cd17793 type II toxin-antitoxin sytem toxin HipA and similar proteins. This family contains type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system HipA family toxins similar to Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis HipA, which is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that phosphorylates Glu-tRNA-ligase (GltX), preventing it from being charged, leading to an increase in uncharged tRNA(Glu). This induces amino acid starvation and the stringent response via RelA/SpoT and increased (p)ppGpp levels, which inhibits replication, transcription, translation and cell wall synthesis, reducing growth and leading to persistence and multidrug resistance. HipA is the toxin component of the HipA-HipB TA module that is a major factor in persistence and bioflim formation; its toxic effect is neutralized by its cognate antitoxin HipB. HipA, with HipB, acts as a a corepressor for transcription of the hipBA promoter. Structures of HipAB:DNA complexes from both Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis reveal distinct complex assembly.</td>

            <td id=al>pfam07804 HipA-like C-terminal domain. The members of this family are similar to a region close to the C-terminus of the HipA protein expressed by various bacterial species. This protein is known to be involved in high-frequency persistence to the lethal effects of inhibition of either DNA or peptidoglycan synthesis. When expressed alone, it is toxic to bacterial cells, but it is usually tightly associated with HipB, and the HipA-HipB complex may be involved in autoregulation of the hip operon. The hip proteins may be involved in cell division control and may interact with cell division genes or their products.</td>

This family contains type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system HipA family toxins similar to Escherichia coli HipA, a serine/threonine-protein kinase that phosphorylates Glu-tRNA-ligase (GltX), preventing it from being charged, leading to an increase in uncharged tRNA(Glu).

HipA, with HipB, acts as a a corepressor for transcription of the hipBA promoter. In the Escherichia coli HipAB:DNA promoter complex, HipA forms a dimer and each HipA monomer interacts with a HipB homodimer which binds DNA. The HipAB component of the complex is composed of two HipA and four HipB subunits.</td>

Although Pfam models pfam07805 and pfam07804 currently are called HipA-like N-terminal domain and HipA-like C-terminal domain, respectively, those models hit the central and C-terminal regions of E. coli HipA but not the N-terminal region. This model hits the N-terminal region of HipA and its homologs, and also identifies proteins that lack match regions for pfam07804 and pfam07805.</td>
