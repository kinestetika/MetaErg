            <td id=al>o-succinylbenzoate synthase. This model describes the enzyme o-succinylbenzoic acid synthetase (menC) that is involved in one of the steps of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway. It takes SHCHC and makes it into 2-succinylbenzoate. Included in this model are gamma proteobacteria and archaea. Many of the com-names of the proteins identified by the model are identified as O-succinylbenzoyl-CoA synthase in error.

Menaquinone is an essential cofactor for anaerobic growth in eubacteria and some archaea. OSBS belongs to the enolase superfamily of enzymes, characterized by the presence of an enolate anion intermediate which is generated by abstraction of the alpha-proton of the carboxylate substrate by an active site residue and is stabilized by coordination to the essential Mg2+ ion.</td>

            <td id=al>Muconate lactonizing enzyme (MLE) like subgroup of the enolase superfamily. Enzymes of this subgroup share three conserved carboxylate ligands for the essential divalent metal ion (usually Mg2+), two aspartates and a glutamate, and residues that can function as general acid/base catalysts, a Lys-X-Lys motif and another conserved lysine. Despite these conserved residues, the members of the MLE subgroup, like muconate lactonizing enzyme, o-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS) and N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR), catalyze different reactions.</td>

The genomic context and the substrate specificity of characterized members of this family from E.coli and B.subtilis indicates a possible role in the metabolism of the murein peptide of peptidoglycan, of which L-Ala-D-Glu is a component. L-Ala-D/L-Glu epimerase is a member of the enolase-superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of an enolate anion intermediate which is generated by abstraction of the alpha-proton of the carboxylate substrate by an active site residue and is stabilized by coordination to the essential Mg2+ ion.</td>

NAAAR is a member of the enolase superfamily, characterized by the presence of an enolate anion intermediate which is generated by abstraction of the alpha-proton of the carboxylate substrate by an active site residue and is stabilized by coordination to the essential Mg2+ ion.</td>

This pathway is used in soil microbes to breakdown lignin-derived aromatics, catechol and protocatechuate, to citric acid cycle intermediates. Some bacterial species are also capable of dehalogenating chloroaromatic compounds by the action of chloromuconate lactonizing enzymes (Cl-MLEs). MLEs are members of the enolase superfamily characterized by the presence of an enolate anion intermediate which is generated by abstraction of the alpha-proton of the carboxylate substrate by an active site residue and that is stabilized by coordination to the essential Mg2+ ion.</td>
