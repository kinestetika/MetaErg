Typically, the vWA domain is made up of approximately 200 amino acid residues folded into a classic a/b para-rossmann type of fold. The vWA domain, since its discovery, has drawn great interest because of its widespread occurrence and its involvement in a wide variety of important cellular functions. These include basal membrane formation, cell migration, cell differentiation, adhesion, haemostasis, signaling, chromosomal stability, malignant transformation and in immune defenses  In integrins these domains form heterodimers while in vWF it forms multimers. There are different interaction surfaces of this domain as seen by the various molecules it complexes with. Ligand binding in most cases is mediated by the presence of a metal ion dependent adhesion site termed as the MIDAS motif that is a characteristic feature of most, if not all A domains. Not much is known about the function of the VWA domain in these proteins. The members do have a conserved MIDAS motif. The biochemical function however is not known.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01461 vWA_interalpha trypsin inhibitor (ITI): ITI is a glycoprotein composed of three polypeptides- two heavy chains and one light chain (bikunin). Bikunin confers the protease-inhibitor function while the heavy chains are involved in rendering stability to the extracellular matrix by binding to hyaluronic acid. The heavy chains carry the VWA domain with a conserved MIDAS motif. Although the exact role of the VWA domains remains unknown, it has been speculated to be involved in mediating protein-protein interactions with the components of the extracellular matrix.</td>

Integrins from invertebrates have been identified from six phyla. There are no data to date to suggest  any immunological functions for the invertebrate integrins.
