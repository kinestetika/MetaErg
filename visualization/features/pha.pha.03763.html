Uncharacterized subfamily of the heavy metal-transporting ATPases (Type IB ATPases) which transport heavy metal ions (Cu(+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), etc.) across biological membranes. The characteristic N-terminal heavy metal associated (HMA) domain of this group is essential for the binding of metal ions. This subfamily belongs to the P-type ATPases, a large family of integral membrane transporters that are of critical importance in all kingdoms of life. They generate and maintain (electro-) chemical gradients across cellular membranes, by translocating cations, heavy metals and lipids, and are distinguished from other main classes of transport ATPases (F- , V- , and ABC- type) by the formation of a phosphorylated (P-) intermediate state in the catalytic cycle.</td>

Heavy metal-transporting ATPases (Type IB ATPases) transport heavy metal ions (Cu(+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), etc.) across biological membranes. These ATPases include mammalian copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B, Bacillus subtilis CadA which transports cadmium, zinc and cobalt out of the cell, Bacillus subtilis ZosA/PfeT which transports copper, and perhaps also zinc and ferrous iron, Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA and CopB, Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 CadA, a cadmium-efflux ATPase, and Escherichia coli ZntA which is selective for Pb(2+), Zn(2+), and Cd(2+).

            <td id=al>cd02094 P-type heavy metal-transporting ATPase, similar to human copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B. The mammalian copper-transporting P-type ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B are key molecules required for the regulation and maintenance of copper homeostasis. Menkes and Wilson diseases are caused by mutation in ATP7A and ATP7B respectively. This subfamily includes other copper-transporting ATPases such as: Bacillus subtilis CopA , Archeaoglobus fulgidus CopA, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ccc2p. This subclass of P-type ATPase is also referred to as CPx-type ATPases because their amino acid sequences contain a characteristic CPC or CPH motif associated with a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids and N-terminal ion-binding sequences.

            <td id=al>cd07551 P-type heavy metal-transporting ATPase, similar to Bacillus subtilis ZosA/PfeT which transports copper, and perhaps zinc under oxidative stress, and perhaps ferrous iron. Bacillus subtilis ZosA/PfeT (previously known as YkvW) transports copper, it may also transport zinc under oxidative stress and may also be involved in ferrous iron efflux. ZosA/PfeT is expressed under the regulation of the peroxide-sensing repressor PerR. It is involved in competence development. Disruption of the zosA/pfeT gene results in low transformability.

            <td id=al>TIGR01512 heavy metal-(Cd/Co/Hg/Pb/Zn)-translocating P-type ATPase. This model describes the P-type ATPase primarily responsible for translocating cadmium ions (and other closely-related divalent heavy metals such as cobalt, mercury, lead and zinc) across biological membranes. These transporters are found in prokaryotes and plants. Experimentally characterized members of the seed alignment include: SP|P37617 from E. coli, SP|Q10866 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SP|Q59998 from Synechocystis PCC6803. The cadmium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IB based on a phylogenetic analysis which combines the copper-translocating ATPases with the cadmium-translocating species. This model and that describing the copper-ATPases (TIGR01511) are well separated, and thus we further type the copper-ATPases as IB1 and the cadmium-ATPases as IB2. Several sequences which have not been characterized experimentally fall just below trusted cutoff for both of these models (SP|Q9CCL1 from Mycobacterium leprae, GP|13816263 from Sulfolobus solfataricus, OMNI|NTL01CJ01098 from Campylobacter jejuni, OMNI|NTL01HS01687 from Halobacterium sp., GP|6899169 from Ureaplasma urealyticum and OMNI|HP1503 from Helicobacter pylori).

            <td id=al>cd07548 P-type heavy metal-transporting ATPase, similar to Bacillus subtilis CadA which appears to transport cadmium, zinc and cobalt but not copper out of the cell. Bacillus subtilis CadA/YvgW appears to transport cadmium, zinc and cobalt but not copper, out of the cell. Functions in metal ion resistance and cellular metal ion homeostasis. CadA/YvgW is also important for sporulation in B. subtilis, the significant specific expression of the cadA/yvgW gene during the late stage of sporulation, is controlled by forespore-specific sigma factor, sigma G, and mother cell-specific sigma factor, sigma E. This subfamily also includes Helicobacter pylori CadA an essential resistance pump with ion specificity towards Cd(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+), and Zn-transporting ATPase, ZiaA(N) in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Transcription of ziaA is induced by Zn under the control of the Zn responsive repressor ZiaR.

KdpFABC is a prokaryotic high-affinity potassium uptake system. It is expressed under K(+) limiting conditions when the other potassium transport systems are not able to provide a sufficient flow of K(+) into the bacteria.

This model describes the P-type ATPase subunit of the complex responsible for translocating potassium ions across biological membranes in microbes. In E. coli and other species, this complex consists of the proteins KdpA, KdpB, KdpC and KdpF. KdpB is the ATPase subunit, while KdpA is the potassium-ion translocating subunit. The function of KdpC is unclear, although cit has been suggested to couple the ATPase subunit to the ion-translocating subunit, while KdpF serves to stabilize the complex. The potassium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IA based on a phylogenetic analysis which places this clade closest to the heavy-metal translocating ATPases (Type IB). Others place this clade closer to the Na+/K+ antiporter type (Type IIC) based on physical characteristics. This model is very clear-cut, with a strong break between trusted hits and noise. All members of the seed alignment, from Clostridium, Anabaena and E. coli are in the characterized table. One sequence above trusted, OMNI|NTL01TA01282, is apparently mis-annotated in the primary literature, but properly annotated by TIGR.

Animal PMCAs function to export Ca(2+) from cells and play a role in regulating Ca(2+) signals following stimulus induction and in preventing calcium toxicity. Many PMCA pump variants exist due to alternative splicing of transcripts. PMCAs are regulated by the binding of calmodulin or by kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar transporter Pmc1p facilitates the accumulation of Ca2+ into vacuoles. Pmc1p is not regulated by direct calmodulin binding but responds to the calmodulin/calcineurin-signaling pathway and is controlled by the transcription factor complex Tcn1p/Crz1p.  Similarly, the expression of the gene for Dictyostelium discoideum Ca(2+)-ATPase PAT1, patA, is under the control of a calcineurin-dependent transcription factor. Plant vacuolar Ca(2+)-ATPases, are regulated by direct-calmodulin binding.

It re-sequesters cytoplasmic Ca(2+) to the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum store, thereby also terminating Ca(2+)-induced signaling such as in muscle contraction. Three genes (ATP2A1-3/SERCA1-3) encode SERCA pumps in mammals, further isoforms exist due to alternative splicing of transcripts.

This model describes the P-type ATPases responsible for the exchange of either protons or sodium ions for potassium ions across the plasma membranes of eukaryotes. Unlike most other P-type ATPases, members of this subfamily require a beta subunit for activity. This model encompasses eukaryotes and consists of two functional types, a Na/K antiporter found widely distributed in eukaryotes and a H/K antiporter found only in vertebrates. The Na+ or H+/K+ antiporter P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IIC based on a published phylogenetic analysis.

Experimental evidence is needed to determine whether these sequences represent ATPases with conserved function. Aside from fragments, other sequences between trusted and noise appear to be bacterial ATPases of unclear lineage, but most likely calcium pumps.
