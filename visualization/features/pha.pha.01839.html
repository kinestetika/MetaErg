N-terminal domain of the M1P-guanylyltransferase A-isoform like proteins:  The proteins of this family are likely to be a isoform of GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase. Their sequences are highly conserved with mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase, but  generally about 40-60 bases longer.  GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GTP: alpha-d-mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase) catalyzes the formation of GDP-d-mannose from GTP and alpha-d-mannose-1-Phosphate. It contains an N-terminal catalytic domain that resembles a dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold and a C-terminal LbH fold domain. GDP-d-mannose is the activated form of mannose for formation of cell wall lipoarabinomannan and various mannose-containing glycolipids and polysaccharides.

N-terminal domain of eEIF-2B epsilon and gamma, subunits of eukaryotic translation initiators, is a subfamily of glycosyltranferase 2 and is predicted to have glycosyltranferase activity. eIF-2B is a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor which mediates the exchange of GDP (bound to initiation factor eIF2) for GTP, generating active eIF2.GTP complex. EIF2B is a complex multimeric protein consisting of five subunits named alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon. Subunit epsilon shares sequence similarity with gamma subunit, and with a family of bifunctional nucleotide-binding enzymes such as ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, suggesting that epsilon subunit may play roles in nucleotide binding activity. In yeast, eIF2B gamma enhances the activity of eIF2B-epsilon leading to the idea that these subunits form the catalytic subcomplex.</td>

This family contains proteins similar to prokaryotic phosphocholine (P-cho) cytidylyltransferases. Phosphocholine (PC) cytidylyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a cytidine monophosphate from CTP to phosphocholine to form CDP-choline. PC is the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic membranes and it is also important in prokaryotic membranes. For pathogenic prokaryotes, the cell surface PC facilitates the interaction with host surface and induces attachment and invasion. In addition cell wall PC serves as scaffold for a group of choline-binding proteins that are secreted from the cells. Phosphocholine (PC) cytidylyltransferase is a key enzyme in the prokaryotic choline metabolism pathway. It has been hypothesized to consist of a choline transport system, a choline kinase, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, and a choline phosphotransferase that transfers P-Cho from CDP-Cho to either lipoteichoic acid or lipopolysaccharide.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03356 Left-handed parallel beta-Helix (LbH) domain of a group of proteins with similarity to glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase: Included in this family are glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-2B subunits, epsilon and gamma. Most members of this family contains an N-terminal catalytic domain that resembles a dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold, followed by a LbH fold domain with at least 4 turns, each containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X). eIF-2B epsilon contains an additional domain of unknown function at the C-terminus. Proteins containing hexapeptide repeats are often enzymes showing acyltransferase activity.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04197 The N-terminal domain of epsilon subunit of the eIF-2B is a subfamily of glycosyltransferase 2. N-terminal domain of epsilon subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF-2B): eIF-2B is a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor which mediates the exchange of GDP (bound to initiation factor eIF2) for GTP, generating active eIF2.GTP complex. EIF2B is a complex multimeric protein consisting of five subunits named alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon. Subunit epsilon shares sequence similarity with gamma subunit, and with a family of bifunctional nucleotide-binding enzymes such as ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, suggesting that epsilon subunit may play roles in nucleotide binding activity. In yeast, eIF2B gamma enhances the activity of eIF2B-epsilon leading to the idea that these subunits form the catalytic subcomplex.</td>
