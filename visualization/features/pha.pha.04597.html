            <td id=al>cd02932 Old yellow enzyme (OYE) YqjM-like FMN binding domain. YqjM is involved in the oxidative stress response of Bacillus subtilis.  Like the other OYE members, each monomer of YqjM contains FMN as a non-covalently bound cofactor and uses NADPH as a reducing agent.   The YqjM enzyme exists as a homotetramer that is assembled as a dimer of catalytically dependent dimers, while other OYE members exist only as monomers or dimers. Moreover, the protein displays a shared active site architecture where an arginine finger at the COOH terminus of one monomer extends into the active site of the adjacent monomer and is directly involved in substrate recognition. Another remarkable difference in the binding of the ligand in YqjM is represented by the contribution of the NH2-terminal tyrosine instead of a COOH-terminal tyrosine in OYE and its homologs.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02930 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (DCR) FMN-binding domain.  DCR in E. coli  is an iron-sulfur flavoenzyme which contains FMN, FAD, and a 4Fe-4S cluster. It is also a monomer, unlike that of its eukaryotic counterparts which form homotetramers and lack the flavin and iron-sulfur cofactors. Metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids requires auxiliary enzymes in addition to those used in b-oxidation. After a given number of cycles through the b-oxidation pathway, those unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs with double bonds at even-numbered carbon positions contain 2-trans, 4-cis double bonds that can not be modified by enoyl-CoA hydratase. DCR utilizes NADPH to remove the C4-C5 double bond. DCR can catalyze the reduction of both natural fatty acids with cis double bonds, as well as substrates containing trans double bonds. The reaction is initiated by hybrid transfer from NADPH to FAD, which in turn transfers electrons, one at a time, to FMN via the 4Fe-4S cluster. The fully reduced FMN provides a hydrid ion to the C5 atom of substrate, and Tyr and His are proposed to form a catalytic dyad that protonates the C4 atom of the substrate and completes the reaction.</td>

Members of this related protein family occur in the vicinity of the putative mycofactocin biosynthesis operon in a number of Actinobacteria such as Frankia sp. and Rhodococcus sp., in Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum SI (Firmicutes), and in Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4 (Deltaproteobacteria).

            <td id=al>cd02929 Trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH) and histamine dehydrogenase (HD) FMN-binding domain.  TMADH is an iron-sulfur flavoprotein that catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine to form dimethylamine and formaldehyde. The protein forms a symetrical dimer with each subunit containing one 4Fe-4S cluster and one FMN cofactor.  It contains a unique flavin, in the form of a 6-S-cysteinyl FMN  which is bent by ~25 degrees along the N5-N10 axis of the flavin isoalloxazine ring. This modification of the conformation of the flavin is thought to facilitate catalysis.The closely related histamine dehydrogenase catalyzes oxidative deamination of histamine.</td>
