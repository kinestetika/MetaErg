            <td id=al>cd02966 TlpA-like family; composed of  TlpA, ResA, DsbE and similar proteins. TlpA, ResA and DsbE are bacterial protein disulfide reductases with important roles in cytochrome maturation. They are membrane-anchored proteins with a soluble TRX domain containing a CXXC motif located in the periplasm. The TRX domains of this family contain an insert, approximately 25 residues in length, which correspond to an extra alpha helix and a beta strand when compared with TRX. TlpA catalyzes an essential reaction in the biogenesis of cytochrome aa3, while ResA and DsbE are essential proteins in cytochrome c maturation. Also included in this family are proteins containing a TlpA-like TRX domain with domain architectures similar to E. coli DipZ protein, and the N-terminal TRX domain of PilB protein from Neisseria which acts as a disulfide reductase that can recylce methionine sulfoxide reductases.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02950 TRX-like protein A (TxlA) family; TxlA was originally isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus. It is found only in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. TRX is a small enzyme that participate in redox reactions, via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol present in a CXXC motif. Disruption of the txlA gene suggests that the protein is involved in the redox regulation  of the structure and function of photosynthetic apparatus. The plant homolog (designated as HCF164) is localized in the chloroplast and is involved in the assembly of the cytochrome b6f complex, which takes a central position in photosynthetic electron transport.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02947 TRX family; composed of two groups: Group I, which includes proteins that exclusively encode a TRX domain; and Group II, which are composed of fusion proteins of TRX and additional domains. Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03010 TlpA-like family, DsbE (also known as CcmG and CycY) subfamily; DsbE is a membrane-anchored, periplasmic TRX-like reductase containing a CXXC motif that specifically donates reducing equivalents to apocytochrome c via CcmH, another cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) factor with a redox active CXXC motif. Assembly of cytochrome c requires the ligation of heme to reduced thiols of the apocytochrome. In bacteria, this assembly occurs in the periplasm. The reductase activity of DsbE in the oxidizing environment of the periplasm is crucial in the maturation of cytochrome c.</td>
