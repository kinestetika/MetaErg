Member of this family are ribonuclease Z, a tRNA 3-prime endonuclease that processes tRNAs to prepare for addition of CCA. In species where all tRNA sequences already have the CCA tail, such as E. coli, the need for such an enzyme is unclear. Protein similar to the E. coli enzyme, matched by TIGRFAMs model TIGR02649, are designated ribonuclease BN. [Transcription, RNA processing]</td>

Escherichia coli zinc phosphodiesterase (ZiPD, also known as ecoZ, tRNase Z, or RNase BN) is a 3' tRNA-processing endonuclease, encoded by the elaC gene. Two forms of RNase Z exist in eukaryotes, one long (ELAC2) and one short form (ELAC1), the former may have resulted from a duplication of the shorter enzyme; this subgroup includes the short form (ELAC1). Only the short form exists in bacteria.
