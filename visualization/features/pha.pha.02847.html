Dihydroxyacetone is then phosphorylated by dihydroxyacetone kinase and enters the glycolytic pathway for further degradation.

            <td id=al>cd07766 Dehydroquinate synthase-like (DHQ-like) and iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases (Fe-ADH). This superfamily consists of two subgroups: the dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS)-like, and a large metal-containing alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), known as iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases. Dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) catalyzes the conversion of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) to dehydroquinate (DHQ) in the second step of the shikimate pathway. This pathway involves seven sequential enzymatic steps in the conversion of erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate into chorismate for subsequent synthesis of aromatic compounds. Dehydroquinate synthase-like group includes dehydroquinate synthase, 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase, and 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase. The alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in this superfamily contain a dehydroquinate synthase-like protein structural fold and mostly contain iron. They are distinct from other alcohol dehydrogenases which contains different protein domains. There are several distinct families of alcohol dehydrogenases: Zinc-containing long-chain alcohol dehydrogenases; insect-type, or short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases; iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases, and others. The iron-containing family has a Rossmann fold-like topology that resembles the fold of the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, but lacks sequence homology, and differs in strand arrangement. ADH catalyzes the reversible oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde with the simultaneous reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08173 Sn-glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gro1PDH) catalyzes the reversible conversion between dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol-1-phosphate using either NADH or NADPH as a coenzyme. Sn-glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gro1PDH, EC 1.1.1.261) plays an important role in the formation of the enantiomeric configuration of the glycerophosphate backbone (sn-glycerol-1-phosphate) of archaeal ether lipids. It catalyzes the reversible conversion between dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol-1-phosphate using either NADH or NADPH as a coenzyme. The activity is zinc-dependent. One characteristic feature of archaea is that their cellular membrane has an ether linkage between the glycerol backbone and the hydrocarbon residues. The polar lipids of the members of Archaea consist of di- and tetra-ethers of glycerol with isoprenoid alcohols bound at the sn-2 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol moiety. The archaeal polar lipids have the enantiomeric configuration of a glycerophosphate backbone [sn-glycerol-1-phosphate (G-1-P)] that is the mirror image structure of the bacterial or eukaryal counterpart [sn-glycerol- 3-phosphate (G-3-P)]. The absolute stereochemistry of the glycerol moiety in all archaeal polar lipids is opposite to that of glycerol ester lipids in bacteria and eukarya.</td>

            <td id=al>cd14861 Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases-like. This family contains proteins similar to iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase (Fe-ADH), most of which have not been characterized. Their specific function is unknown. The protein structure represents a dehydroquinate synthase-like fold and belongs to the alcohol dehydrogenase-like superfamily. It is distinct from other alcohol dehydrogenases which contain different protein domains.  Alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the reduction of acetaldehyde to alcohol with NADP as cofactor. Its activity requires iron ions.</td>
