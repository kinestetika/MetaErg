            <td id=al>cd04630 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains present in bacteria. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>cd04622 CBS pair domain found in Hypoxic Response Protein 1 (HRP1) -like proteinds. Mycobacterium tuberculosis adapts to cellular stresses by upregulation of the dormancy survival regulon.  Hypoxic response protein 1 (HRP1) is encoded by one of the most strongly upregulated genes in the dormancy survival regulon. HRP1 is a 'CBS-domain-only protein; however unlike other CBS containing proteins it does not appear to bind AMP. The biological function of the protein remains unclear, but is thought to contribute to the modulation of the host immune response.

            <td id=al>cd04584 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the ACT domain. The putative Acetoin Utilization Protein (Acub) from Vibrio Cholerae contains a CBS pair domain.  The acetoin utilization protein plays a role in growth and sporulation on acetoin or butanediol for use as a carbon source. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms.  It is used as an external energy store by a number of fermentive bacteria. Acetoin is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be utilised in order to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA or 2,3-butanediol is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex and acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, respectively. Acetoin utilization proteins, acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, and histone deacetylases are members of an ancient protein superfamily.This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in the acetoin utilization proteins in bacteria. Acetoin is a product of fermentative metabolism in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms.  They produce acetoin as an external carbon storage compound and then later reuse it as a carbon and energy source during their stationary phase and sporulation. In addition these CBS domains are associated with a downstream ACT (aspartate kinase/chorismate mutase/TyrA) domain, which is linked to a wide range of metabolic enzymes that are regulated by amino acid concentration. Pairs of ACT domains bind specifically to a particular amino acid leading to regulation of the linked enzyme.

This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the bacterial CAP_ED (cAMP receptor protein effector domain) family of transcription factors, the NT_Pol-beta-like domain, and the DUF294 domain.

In all cases binding of the effector leads to conformational changes and the ability to activate transcription. The NT_Pol-beta-like domain includes the Nucleotidyltransferase (NT) domains of DNA polymerase beta and other family X DNA polymerases, as well as the NT domains of class I and class II CCA-adding enzymes, RelA- and SpoT-like ppGpp synthetases and hydrolases, 2'5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A)synthetases, Escherichia coli adenylyltransferase (GlnE), Escherichia coli uridylyl transferase (GlnD), poly (A) polymerases, terminal uridylyl transferases, Staphylococcus aureus kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase, and similar proteins.

Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domain, present in MUG70. The MUG70 protein, encoded by the Meiotically Up-regulated Gene 70, plays a role in meiosis and contains, beside the two CBS pairs, a PB1 domain. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

This cd contains 2 tandem repeats of the CBS domain in the two-component sensor histidine kinase and related-proteins. Two-component regulation is the predominant form of signal recognition and response coupling mechanism used by bacteria to sense and respond to diverse environmental stresses and cues ranging from common environmental stimuli to host signals recognized by pathogens and bacterial cell-cell communication signals.  The structures of both sensors and regulators are modular, and numerous variations in domain architecture and composition have evolved to tailor to specific needs in signal perception and signal transduction. The simplest histidine kinase sensors consists of only sensing and kinase domains. The more complex hybrid sensors contain an additional REC domain typical of two-component regulators and in some cases a C-terminal histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) domain.
