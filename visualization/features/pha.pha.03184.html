            <td id=al>cd09881 VapC-like PIN domain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis VapC4 and VapC5, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae FitB and related proteins. This family includes the Virulence associated protein C (VapC)-like PIN (PilT N terminus) domain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis VapC4 and VapC5 ribonuclease toxins of the VapBC toxin/antitoxin (TA) system, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae FitB toxin of the FitAB TA system. This family belongs to the VapC-like family of the PIN domain nuclease superfamily. VapC is the PIN-domain ribonuclease toxin from prokaryotic VapBC toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. VapB is a transcription factor-like protein antitoxin acting as an inhibitor. Other members of the VapC-like nuclease family include eukaryotic ribonucleases such as Smg6, ribosome assembly factor NOB1, exosome subunit Rrp44 endoribonuclease and rRNA-processing protein Fcf1. The structural properties of the PIN (PilT N terminus) domain indicate its active center, consisting of three highly conserved catalytic residues which coordinate metal ions, in some members, additional metal coordinating residues can be found. Some members of the superfamily lack several of these key catalytic residues. The PIN active site is geometrically similar in the active center of structure-specific 5' nucleases, PIN-domain ribonucleases of eukaryotic rRNA editing proteins, and bacterial toxins of toxin-antitoxin (TA) operons.</td>
