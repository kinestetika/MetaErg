            <td id=al>TIGR00922 transcription termination/antitermination factor NusG. NusG proteins are transcription factors which are aparrently universal in prokaryotes (archaea and eukaryotes have homologs that may have related functions). The essential components of these factors include an N-terminal RNP-like (ribonucleoprotein) domain and a C-terminal KOW motif (pfam00467) believed to be a nucleic acid binding domain. In E. coli, NusA has been shown to interact with RNA polymerase and termination factor Rho. This model covers a wide variety of bacterial species but excludes mycoplasmas which are covered by a separate model (TIGR01956).The function of all of these NusG proteins is likely to be the same at the level of interaction with RNA and other protein factors to affect termination; however different species may utilize NusG towards different processes and in combination with different suites of affector proteins.In E. coli, NusG promotes rho-dependent termination. It is an essential gene. In Streptomyces virginiae and related species, an additional N-terminal sequence is also present and is suggested to play a role in butyrolactone-mediated autoregulation. In Thermotoga maritima, NusG has a long insert, fails to substitute for E. coli NusG (with or without the long insert), is a large 0.7 % of total cellular protein, and has a general, sequence non-specific DNA and RNA binding activity that blocks ethidium staining, yet permits transcription.Archaeal proteins once termed NusG share the KOW domain but are actually a ribosomal protein corresponding to L24p in bacterial and L26e in eukaryotes (TIGR00405).

The N-Utilization Substance G (NusG) protein is involved in transcription elongation and termination in bacteria. NusG is essential in Escherichia coli and associates with RNA polymerase elongation and Rho-termination. Homologs of the NusG gene exist in all bacteria. The NusG N-terminal domain (NGN) is similar in all NusG homologs, but its C-terminal domain and the linker that separates these two domains are different. The domain organization of NusG suggests that the common properties of NusG and its homologs are due to their similar NGN domains.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06091 NusG contains an NGN domain at its N-terminus and KOW motif at its C-terminus. KOW_NusG motif is one of the two domains of N-Utilization Substance G (NusG) a transcription elongation and Rho-termination factor in bacteria and archaea. KOW domain is known as an RNA-binding motif that is shared so far among some families of ribosomal proteins, the essential bacterial transcriptional elongation factor NusG, the eukaryotic chromatin elongation factor Spt5, the higher eukaryotic KIN17 proteins and Mtr4. The eukaryotic ortholog of NusG is Spt5 with multiple KOW motifs at its C-terminus.</td>

The N-Utilization Substance G (NusG) and its eukaryotic homolog Spt5 are involved in transcription elongation and termination. NusG contains an NGN domain at its N-terminus and Kyrpides Ouzounis and Woese (KOW) repeats at its C-terminus in bacteria and archaea. The eukaryotic ortholog, Spt5, is a large protein composed of an acidic N-terminus, an NGN domain, and multiple KOW motifs at its C-terminus. Spt5 forms a Spt4-Spt5 complex that is an essential RNA Polymerase II elongation factor. NusG was originally discovered as an N-dependent antitermination enhancing activity in Escherichia coli and has a variety of functions, such as being involved in RNA polymerase elongation and Rho-termination in bacteria. Orthologs of the NusG gene exist in all bacteria, but its functions and requirements are different. The diverse activities suggest that, after diverging from a common ancestor, NusG proteins became specialized in different bacteria.</td>

The N-Utilization Substance G (NusG) protein is involved in transcription elongation and termination. NusG is essential in Escherichia coli and associates with RNA polymerase elongation and Rho-termination. Paralogs of eubacterial NusG, NusG SP (Specialized Paralog of NusG), are more diverse and often found as the first ORF in operons encoding secreted proteins and LPS biosynthesis genes. NusG SP family members are operon-specific transcriptional antitermination factors. The NusG N-terminal domain (NGN) is quite similar in all NusG orthologs, but its C-terminal domain and the linker that separates these two domains are different. The domain organization of NusG and its orthologs suggests that the common properties of NusG and its orthologs and paralogs are due to their similar NGN domains.</td>
