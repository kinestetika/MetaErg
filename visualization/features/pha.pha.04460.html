Caulobacter crescentus DivK is an essential response regulator that is involved in the complex phosphorelay pathways controlling both cell division and motility.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CKI1 and Escherichia coli RcsC. This family is composed of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators that are sensor histidine kinases (HKs) fused with a REC domain, similar to the sensor histidine kinase CKI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) signaling that mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. MSP involves a signal being transferred from HKs via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. The CKI1 REC domain specifically interacts with the downstream signaling protein AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. The plant MSP system has evolved from the prokaryotic two-component system (TCS), which allows organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. This family also includes bacterial hybrid sensor HKs such as Escherichia coli RcsC, which is a component of the Rcs signalling pathway that controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division, and motility. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase response regulator RpfG and similar proteins. Cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase response regulator RpfG, together with sensory/regulatory protein RpfC, constitute a two-component system implicated in sensing and responding to the diffusible signal factor (DSF) that is essential for cell-cell signaling. RpfC is a hybrid sensor/histidine kinase that phosphorylates and activates RpfG, which degrades cyclic di-GMP to GMP, leading to the activation of Clp, a global transcriptional regulator that regulates a large set of genes in the DSF pathway. RpfG contains a CheY-like receiver domain attached to a histidine-aspartic acid-glycine-tyrosine-proline (HD-GYP) cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of response regulators (RRs) and pseudo response regulators (PRRs). Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

PhoB is a member of the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators that contains REC and winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding output effector domains.

PA4781 is involved in cyclic di-3',5'-GMP (c-di-GMP) hydrolysis/degradation in a two-step reaction via the linear intermediate pGpG to produce GMP. Its unphosphorylated REC domain prevents accessibility of c-di-GMP to the active site.

Thermotoga maritima RR468 (encoded by gene TM0468) is the cognate response regulator (RR) of the class I histidine kinase HK853 (product of gene TM0853). HK853/RR468 comprise a two-component system (TCS) that couples environmental stimuli to adaptive responses. This subfamily also includes Fremyella diplosiphon complementary adaptation response regulator homolog RcaF, a small RR that is involved in four-step phosphorelays of the complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA) system that occurs in many cyanobacteria. Both RR468 and RcaF are stand-alone RRs containing only a REC domain with no output/effector domain. The REC domain itself functions as an effector domain.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of BsPhoP-like OmpR family response regulators. Bacillus subtilis PhoP (BsPhoP) is part of the PhoPR two-component system that participates in a signal transduction network that controls adaptation of the bacteria to phosphate deficiency by regulating (activating or repressing) genes of the Pho regulon upon phosphorylation by PhoR. When activated, PhoPR directs expression of phosphate scavenging enzymes, lowers synthesis of the phosphate-rich wall teichoic acid (WTA) and initiates synthesis of teichuronic acid, a non-phosphate containing replacement anionic polymer. Members of this subfamily belong to the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators, which are characterized by a REC domain and a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding output effector domain.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of chemotaxis protein CheV and similar proteins. This subfamily includes the REC domains of Bacillus subtilis chemotaxis protein CheV, Myxococcus xanthus gliding motility regulatory protein FrzE, and similar proteins. CheV is a hybrid protein with an N-terminal CheW-like domain and a C-terminal CheY-like REC domain. The CheV pathway is one of three systems employed by B. subtilis for sensory adaptation that contribute to chemotaxis. It is involved in the transmission of sensory signals from chemoreceptors to flagellar motors. Together with CheW, it is involved in the coupling of methyl-accepting chemoreceptors to the central two-component histidine kinase CheA. FrzE is a hybrid sensor histidine kinase/response regulator that is part of the Frz pathway that controls cell reversal frequency to support directional motility during swarming and fruiting body formation. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of PrrA-like OmpR family response regulators. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis PrrA is part of the PrrA/PrrB two-component system (TCS) that has been implicated in early intracellular multiplication and is essential for viability. Also included in this subfamily is Mycobacterium tuberculosis MprA, part of the MprAB TCS that regulates EspR, a key regulator of the ESX-1 secretion system, and is required for establishment and maintenance of persistent infection in a tissue- and stage-specific fashion. PrrA and MprA belong to the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators, which contain N-terminal receiver (REC) and C-terminal DNA-binding winged helix-turn-helix effector domains. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of probable transcriptional regulator Ycf29. Ycf29 is a probable response regulator of a two-component system (TCS), typically consisting a sensor and a response regulator, that functions in adaptation to changing environments. Processes regulated by TCSs in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Ycf29 contains an N-terminal REC domain and a LuxR-type helix-turn-helix DNA-binding output domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
