            <td id=al>WD40 repeats in seven bladed beta propellers. The WD40 repeat is found in a number of eukaryotic proteins that cover a wide variety of functions including adaptor/regulatory modules in signal transduction, pre-mRNA processing, and cytoskeleton assembly. It typically contains a GH dipeptide 11-24 residues from its N-terminus and the WD dipeptide at its C-terminus and is 40 residues long, hence the name WD40. Between the GH and WD dipeptides lies a conserved core. It forms a propeller-like structure with several blades where each blade is composed of a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. The WD40 sequence repeat originally described in literature forms the first three strands of one blade and the last strand in the next blade. The C-terminal WD40 repeat completes the blade structure of the N-terminal WD40 repeat to create the closed ring propeller-structure. The residues on the top and bottom surface of the propeller are proposed to coordinate interactions with other proteins and/or small ligands, allowing them to bind either stably or reversibly.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic kinase domain, second repeat, of the Giant Serine/Threonine Kinase Uncoordinated protein 89. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. The nematode Unc-89 gene, through alternative promoter use and splicing, encodes at least six major isoforms (Unc-89A to Unc-89F) of giant muscle proteins that are homologs for the vetebrate obscurin. In flies, five isoforms of Unc-89 have been detected: four in the muscles of adult flies (two in the indirect flight muscle and two in other muscles) and another isoform in the larva. Unc-89 in nematodes is required for normal muscle cell architecture. In flies, it is necessary for the development of a symmetrical sarcomere in the flight muscles. Unc-89 proteins contain several adhesion and signaling domains including multiple copies of the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, as well as fibronectin type III (FN3), SH3, RhoGEF, and PH domains. The nematode Unc-89 isoforms D, C, D, and F contain two kinase domain with B and F having two complete kinase domains while the first repeat of C and D are partial domains. Homology modeling suggests that the first kinase repeat of Unc-89 may be catalytically inactive, a pseudokinase, while the second kinase repeat may be active. The Unc-89 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>
