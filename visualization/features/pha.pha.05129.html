            <td id=al>cd07217 Patatin-like phospholipase. Patatin is a storage protein of the potato tuber that shows Phospholipase A2 activity (PLA2; EC 3.1.1.4). Patatin catalyzes the nonspecific hydrolysis of phospholipids, glycolipids, sulfolipids, and mono- and diacylglycerols, thereby showing lipid acyl hydrolase activity. The active site includes an oxyanion hole with a conserved GGxR motif; it is found in almost all the members of this family. The catalytic dyad is formed by a serine and an aspartate. Patatin belongs to the alpha-beta hydrolase family which is identified by a characteristic nucleophile elbow with a consensus sequence of Sm-X-Nu-Sm (Sm = small residue, X = any residue and Nu = nucleophile). Members of this family have been found also in vertebrates. This family includes subfamily of PNPLA8 (iPLA2-gamma) and PNPLA9 (iPLA2-beta) like phospholipases from human as well as the Pat17 isozyme from Solanum cardiophyllum.</td>

PNPLA9 is a Ca-independent phospholipase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position. PNPLA9 is also known as PLA2G6 (phospholipase A2 group VI) or iPLA2beta. PLA2G6 is stimulated by ATP and inhibited by bromoenol lactone (BEL). In humans, PNPLA9 in expressed ubiquitously and is involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation, and apoptotic cell death. Mutations in human PLA2G6 leads to infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) and idiopathic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). This family includes PLA2G6 from Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07207 ExoU and VipD-like proteins; homologus to patatin, cPLA2, and iPLA2. ExoU, a 74-kDa enzyme, is a potent virulence factor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One of the pathogenic mechanisms of P. aeruginosa is to induce cytotoxicity by the injection of effector proteins (e.g. ExoU) using the type III secretion (T3S) system. ExoU is homologus to patatin and also has the conserved catalytic residues of mammalian calcium-independent (iPLA2) and cytosolic (cPLA2) PLA2. In vitro, ExoU cytotoxity is blocked by the inhibitor of cytosolic and Ca2-independent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 and iPLA2) enzymes, suggesting that phospholipase A2 inhibitors may represent a novel mode of treatment for acute P. aeruginosa infections. ExoU requires eukaryotic superoxide dismutase as a cofactor and cleaves phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in vitro. VipD, a 69-kDa cytosolic protein, belongs to the members of Legionella pneumophila family and is homologus to ExoU from Pseudomonas. Even though VipD shows high sequence similarity with several functional regions of ExoU (e.g. oxyanion hole, active site serine, active site aspartate), it has been shown to have no phospholipase activity. This family includes ExoU from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and VipD of Legionella pneumophila.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07205 Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 6, protein 7, and fungal NTE1. Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 6 (PNPLA6) and protein 7 (PNPLA7) are included in this family. PNPLA6 is commonly known as Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE). NTE has at least two functional domains: the N-terminal domain putatively regulatory domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain which shows esterase activity. NTE shows phospholipase activity for lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Exposure of NTE to organophosphates leads to organophosphate-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN). OPIDN is a progressive neurological condition that is characterized by weakness, paralysis, pain, and paresthesia. PNPLA7 is an insulin-regulated phospholipase that is homologus to Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE or PNPLA6) and is also known as NTE-related esterase (NRE). Human NRE is predominantly expressed in prostate, white adipose, and pancreatic tissue. NRE hydrolyzes sn-1 esters in lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidic acid, but shows no lipase activity with substrates like triacylglycerols (TG), cholesteryl esters, retinyl esters (RE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), or monoacylglycerol (MG). This family includes subfamily of PNPLA6 (NTE) and PNPLA7 (NRE)-like phospholipases.</td>
