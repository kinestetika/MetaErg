            <td id=al>cd00383 DNA-binding effector domain of two-component system response regulators. Bacteria and some eukaryotes use two-component signal transduction systems to detect and respond to changes in the environment. The systems consists of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. The former autophosphorylates a histidine residue on detecting an external stimulus. The phosphate is then transferred to an invariant aspartate residue in a highly conserved receiver domain of the response regulator. Phosphorylation activates a variable effector domain of the response regulator, which triggers the cellular response. This C-terminal effector domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcriptional regulators and contains DNA and RNA polymerase binding sites. Several dimers or monomers bind head to tail to small tandem repeats upstream of the genes. The RNA polymerase binding sites interact with the alpha or sigma subunit of RNA polymerase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00156 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of response regulators (RRs) and pseudo response regulators (PRRs). Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
