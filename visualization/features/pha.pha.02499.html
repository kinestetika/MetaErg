            <td id=al>cd07734 Int9, Int11, CPSF2, CPSF3 and related cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors; MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase domain. CPSF3 (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 3; also known as cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 73 kDa subunit, CPSF-73) and CPSF2 (also known as cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 100 kDa subunit /CPSF-100) are components of the CPSF complex, which plays a role in 3' end processing of pre-mRNAs during cleavage/polyadenylation, and during processing of metazoan histone pre-mRNAs. CPSF3 functions as a 3' endonuclease. Int11 (also known as cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor (CPSF) 3-like protein, and protein related to CPSF subunits of 68 kDa (RC-68)), and Int9, also known as protein related to CPSF subunits of 74 kDa (RC-74) are subunits of Integrator, a metazoan-specific multifunctional protein complex composed of 14 subunits. Integrator has been implicated in a variety of Pol II transcription events including 3' end processing of snRNA, transcription initiation, promoter-proximal pausing, termination of protein-coding transcripts, and in HVS pre-miRNA 3' end processing. Members of this subgroup belong to the MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase superfamily which is comprised mainly of hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions.</td>

            <td id=al>smart00849 Metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily. Apart from the beta-lactamases a number of other proteins contain this domain. These proteins include thiolesterases, members of the glyoxalase II family, that catalyse the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione to form glutathione and D-lactic acid and a competence protein that is essential for natural transformation in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and could be a transporter involved in DNA uptake. Except for the competence protein these proteins bind two zinc ions per molecule as cofactor.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16273 SNM1A , artemis/SNM1C, yeast Pso2p, and related proteins; MBL-fold metallo-hydrolase domain. Includes human SNM1A (SNM1 homolog A, also known as DNA cross-link repair 1A protein) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pso2 protein (PSOralen derivative sensitive 2, also known as SNM1, sensitive to nitrogen mustard 1), both proteins are 5'-exonucleases and function in interstrand cross-links (ICL) repair. Also includes the nuclease artemis (also known as SNM1C, SNM1 homolog C, SNM1-like protein, and DNA cross-link repair 1C protein) which plays a role in V(D)J recombination/DNA repair. Purified artemis protein possesses single-strand-specific 5' to 3' exonuclease activity. Upon complex formation with, and phosphorylation by, DNA-dependent protein kinase, artemis gains endonucleolytic activity on hairpins and 5' and 3' overhangs.

            <td id=al>cd06262 mainly hydrolytic enzymes and related proteins which carry out various biological functions; MBL-fold metallohydrolase domain. Members of the MBL-fold metallohydrolase superfamily are mainly hydrolytic enzymes which carry out a variety of biological functions. The class B metal beta-lactamases (MBLs) for which this fold was named perform only a small fraction of the activities included in this superfamily. Activities carried out by superfamily members include class B beta-lactamases which can catalyze the hydrolysis of a wide range of beta-lactam antibiotics, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases (also called glyoxalase II) which hydrolyze S-d-lactoylglutathione to d-lactate in the second step of the glycoxlase system, AHL lactonases which catalyze the hydrolysis and opening of the homoserine lactone rings of acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), persulfide dioxygenase which catalyze the oxidation of glutathione persulfide to glutathione and persulfite in the mitochondria, flavodiiron proteins which catalyze the reduction of oxygen and/or nitric oxide to water or nitrous oxide respectively, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors such as the Int9 and Int11 subunits of Integrator, Sdsa1-like and AtsA-like arylsulfatases, 5'-exonucleases human SNM1A and yeast Pso2p, ribonuclease J which has both 5'-3' exoribonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activity and ribonuclease Z which catalyzes the endonucleolytic removal of the 3' extension of the majority of tRNA precursors, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases which decompose cyclic adenosine and guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP and cGMP) respectively, insecticide hydrolases, and proteins required for natural transformation competence. The diversity of biological roles is reflected in variations in the active site metallo-chemistry, for example classical members of the superfamily are di-, or less commonly mono-, zinc-ion-dependent hydrolases, human persulfide dioxygenase ETHE1 is a mono-iron binding member of the superfamily; Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolases incorporates iron, manganese, and zinc in its dinuclear metal binding site, and flavodiiron proteins contains a diiron site.</td>

This subgroup includes Methanocaldococcus jannaschii 7,8-dihydropterin-6-methyl-4-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-aminobenzene-5'-phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.15), a folate biosynthetic enzyme also known as dihydropteroate synthase and 7,8 dihydropteroate synthase. Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis Tflp is a ferredoxin-like member.
