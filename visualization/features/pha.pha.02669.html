            <td id=al>Metal binding protein PsaA.  These proteins have been shown to function as initial receptors in ABC transport of Mn2+ and as surface adhesins in some eubacterial species.  They belong to the TroA superfamily of periplasmic metal binding proteins that share a distinct fold and ligand binding mechanism. A typical TroA protein is comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a single helix and can bind the metal ion in the cleft between these domains. In addition, these proteins sometimes have a low complexity region containing a metal-binding histidine-rich motif (repetitive HDH sequence).</td>

            <td id=al>Zinc-uptake complex component A periplasmic. ZnuA includes periplasmic solute binding proteins such as TroA that interacts with an ATP-binding cassette transport system in Treponema pallidum. ZnuA is part of the bacterial zinc-uptake complex ZnuABC, whose components are the following families, ZinT, pfam09223, pfam00950, pfam00005, all of which are regulated by the transcription-regulator family FUR, pfam01475. ZinT acts as a Zn2+-buffering protein that delivers Zn2+ to ZnuA (TroA), a high-affinity zinc-uptake protein. In Gram-negative bacteria the ZnuABC transporter system ensures an adequate import of zinc in Zn2+-poor environments, such as those encountered by pathogens within the infected host.</td>

Some homologs (lacking the insert) have been described as transporters of manganese or of chelated iron. Members of this family typically are found along with an ATP-binding cassette protein, a permease, and an LPXTG-anchored protein with two or three copies of the TIGR03769 insert that occurs just once in this protein family.

These proteins have been shown to function in the ABC transport of ferric siderophores and metal ions such as Mn2+, Fe3+, Cu2+ and/or Zn2+.  Their ligand binding site is formed in the interface between two globular domains linked by a single helix.  Many of these proteins also possess a low complexity region containing a metal-binding histidine-rich motif (repetitive HDH sequence).  The TroA-like proteins differ in their fold and ligand-binding mechanism from the PBPI and PBPII proteins, but are structurally similar, however, to the beta-subunit of the nitrogenase molybdenum-iron protein MoFe.   Most TroA-like proteins are encoded by ABC-type operons and appear to function as periplasmic components of ABC transporters in metal ion uptake.</td>
