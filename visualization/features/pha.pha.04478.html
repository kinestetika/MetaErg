XPB is a DEAD-like helicase belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases.

            <td id=al>DEXH-box helicase domain of type III restriction enzyme res subunit. Members of this cd includes both type I and type III restriction enzymes. Both are hetero-oligomeric proteins. Type I REs are encoded by three closely linked genes: a specificity subunit (HsdS or S) for recognizing a DNA sequence, a methylation subunit (HsdM or M) for methylating the recognized target bases, and a restriction subunit (HsdR or R) for the translocation and random cleavage of non-methylated DNA. They show diverse catalytic activities, including methyltransferase (MTase), ATP hydrolase (ATPase), DNA translocation and restriction activities. These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site. Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation, which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions: one containing 3-4 nucleotides, and another containing 4-5 nucleotides, separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6-8 nucleotides. Type III enzymes are composed of two subunits, Res and Mod. The Mod subunit recognizes the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification methyltransferase; as such, it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonucleases. Res is required for restriction, although it has no enzymatic activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognize short 5-6 bp-long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25-27 bp downstream to leave short, single-stranded 5' protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction to occur. These enzymes methylate only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenosyl residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction. Both type I and type III REs are members of the DEAD-like helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.</td>

Some organisms, such as Homo sapiens and Caenorhabditis elegans, encode one Dicer that generates miRNAs and siRNAs, but other organisms have multiple dicers with specialized functions. Dicers exist throughout eukaryotes, and a subset have an N-terminal helicase domain of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) subgroup.

            <td id=al>C-terminal helicase domain of Fanconi anemia group M family helicases. Fanconi anemia group M (FANCM) protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex. It is required for the normal activation of the FA pathway, leading to monoubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex in response to DNA damage, cellular resistance to DNA cross-linking drugs, and prevention of chromosomal breakage. Hef (helicase-associated endonuclease fork-structure) belongs to the XPF/MUS81/FANCM family of endonucleases and is involved in stalled replication fork repair. FANCM and Hef are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA. This model describes the C-terminal domain, also called HelicC.</td>

            <td id=al>DEXH-box helicase domain of DEAD-like helicase Ski2 family proteins. Ski2-like RNA helicases play an important role in RNA degradation, processing, and splicing pathways. They belong to the type II DEAD box helicase superfamily, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. This domain contains the ATP-binding region.</td>
