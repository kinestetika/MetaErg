Obg is an essential gene that is involved in DNA replication in C. crescentus and Streptomyces griseus and is associated with the ribosome. Several members of the family, including YchF, possess the TGS domain related to the RNA-binding proteins. Experimental data and genomic analysis suggest that YchF may be part of a nucleoprotein complex and may function as a GTP-dependent translational factor.</td>

            <td id=al>cd04867 TGS (ThrRS, GTPase and SpoT) domain found in the YchF/OLA1 family proteins. The YchF/Ola1 family includes bacterial ribosome-binding ATPase YchF as well as its human homolog Obg-like ATPase 1 (OLA1), both of which belong to the Obg family of GTPases, and are novel ATPases that bind and hydrolyze ATP more efficiently than GTP. They have been associated with various cellular processes and pathologies, including DNA repair, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis, in addition to the regulation of the oxidative stress response. OLA1 is also termed DNA damage-regulated overexpressed in cancer 45 (DOC45), or GTP-binding protein 9 (GTPBP9). It is over-expressed in several human malignancies, including cancers of the colon, rectum, ovary, lung, stomach, and uterus. It is linked to the cellular stress response and tumorigenesis, and may also serve as a valuable tumor marker. Members in this family contain a central Obg-type G (guanine nucleotide-binding) domain, flanked by a coiled-coil domain and this TGS (ThrRS, GTPase, SpoT) domain of unknown function.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01881 Obg-like family of GTPases consist of five subfamilies: Obg, DRG, YyaF/YchF, Ygr210, and NOG1. The Obg-like subfamily consists of five well-delimited, ancient subfamilies, namely Obg, DRG, YyaF/YchF, Ygr210, and NOG1. Four of these groups (Obg, DRG, YyaF/YchF, and Ygr210) are characterized by a distinct glycine-rich motif immediately following the Walker B motif (G3 box). Obg/CgtA is an essential gene that is involved in the initiation of sporulation and DNA replication in the bacteria Caulobacter and Bacillus, but its exact molecular role is unknown. Furthermore, several OBG family members possess a C-terminal RNA-binding domain, the TGS domain, which is also present in threonyl-tRNA synthetase and in bacterial guanosine polyphosphatase SpoT. Nog1 is a nucleolar protein that might function in ribosome assembly. The DRG and Nog1 subfamilies are ubiquitous in archaea and eukaryotes, the Ygr210 subfamily is present in archaea and fungi, and the Obg and YyaF/YchF subfamilies are ubiquitous in bacteria and eukaryotes. The Obg/Nog1 and DRG subfamilies appear to form one major branch of the Obg family and the Ygr210 and YchF subfamilies form another branch. No GEFs, GAPs, or GDIs for Obg have been identified.</td>

Among eukaryotes, the Ygr210 subfamily is represented only in fungi. These fungal proteins form a tight cluster with their archaeal orthologs, which suggests the possibility of horizontal transfer from archaea to fungi.</td>

Members of the subfamily contain two equally and highly conserved domains, a C-terminal GTP binding domain and an N-terminal glycine-rich domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01896 Developmentally Regulated GTP-binding protein (DRG). The developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein (DRG) subfamily is an uncharacterized member of the Obg family, an evolutionary branch of GTPase superfamily proteins. GTPases act as molecular switches regulating diverse cellular processes. DRG2 and DRG1 comprise the DRG subfamily in eukaryotes. In view of their widespread expression in various tissues and high conservation among distantly related species in eukaryotes and archaea, DRG proteins may regulate fundamental cellular processes. It is proposed that the DRG subfamily proteins play their physiological roles through RNA binding.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01616 TGS (ThrRS, GTPase and SpoT) domain structurally similar to a beta-grasp ubiquitin-like fold. This family includes eukaryotic and some bacterial threonyl-tRNA synthetases (ThrRSs), a distinct Obg family GTPases, and guanosine polyphosphate hydrolase (SpoT) and synthetase (RelA), which are involved in stringent response in bacteria, as well as uridine kinase (UDK) from Thermotogales. All family members contain a TGS domain named after the ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT/RelA proteins where it occurs. It is a small domain with a beta-grasp ubiquitin-like fold, a common structure involved in protein-protein interactions. The functions of the TGS domain remains unclear, but its presence in two types of regulatory proteins (the GTPases and guanosine polyphosphate phosphohydrolases/synthetases) suggests a ligand (most likely nucleotide)-binding, with a regulatory role.</td>

The Obg family of GTPases function has been implicated in cellular processes as diverse as sporulation, stress response, control of DNA replication, and ribosome assembly. It consists of several subfamilies such as DRG and YchF with TGS domain. The TGS domain is named after the various RNA-binding multidomain ThrRS, GTPase, and SpoT/RelA proteins in which this domain occurs. The TGS domain of Obg-like GTPases such as those present in DRG (developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein), and GTP-binding proteins Ygr210 and YchF has a beta-grasp ubiquitin-like fold, a common structure involved in protein-protein interactions.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00880 E. coli Ras-like protein (Era)-like GTPase. The Era (E. coli Ras-like protein)-like family includes several distinct subfamilies (TrmE/ThdF, FeoB, YihA (EngB), Era, and EngA/YfgK) that generally show sequence conservation in the region between the Walker A and B motifs (G1 and G3 box motifs), to the exclusion of other GTPases. TrmE is ubiquitous in bacteria and is a widespread mitochondrial protein in eukaryotes, but is absent from archaea. The yeast member of TrmE family, MSS1, is involved in mitochondrial translation; bacterial members are often present in translation-related operons. FeoB represents an unusual adaptation of GTPases for high-affinity iron (II) transport. YihA (EngB) family of GTPases is typified by the E. coli YihA, which is an essential protein involved in cell division control. Era is characterized by a distinct derivative of the KH domain (the pseudo-KH domain) which is located C-terminal to the GTPase domain. EngA and its orthologs are composed of two GTPase domains and, since the sequences of the two domains are more similar to each other than to other GTPases, it is likely that an ancient gene duplication, rather than a fusion of evolutionarily distinct GTPases, gave rise to this family.</td>
