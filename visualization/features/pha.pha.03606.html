            <td id=al>cd05333 beta-Keto acyl carrier protein reductase (BKR), involved in Type II FAS, classical (c) SDRs. This subgroup includes the Escherichai coli K12 BKR, FabG. BKR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ACP in the first reductive step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS). FAS consists of four elongation steps, which are repeated to extend the fatty acid chain through the addition of two-carbo units from malonyl acyl-carrier protein (ACP): condensation, reduction, dehydration, and a final reduction. Type II FAS, typical of plants and many bacteria, maintains these activities on discrete polypeptides, while type I FAS utilizes one or two multifunctional polypeptides. BKR resembles enoyl reductase, which catalyzes the second reduction step in FAS. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) NAD(P)(H) binding region and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues.   Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns.  These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H) binding pattern: TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs.  Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif.  Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P) binding motif and  an altered active site motif (YXXXN).  Fungal type type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.  Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P) binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues.  Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site.  Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr-151 and Lys-155, and well as Asn-111 (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix motif that is not generally found among SDRs.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05358 glucose 1 dehydrogenase (GlcDH), classical (c) SDRs. GlcDH, is a tetrameric member of the SDR family, it catalyzes the NAD(P)-dependent oxidation of beta-D-glucose to D-glucono-delta-lactone. GlcDH has a typical NAD-binding site glycine-rich pattern as well as the canonical active site tetrad (YXXXK motif plus upstream Ser and Asn). SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN).

            <td id=al>TIGR01829 acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. This model represent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, a member of the family short-chain-alcohol dehydrogenases. Note that, despite the precision implied by the enzyme name, the reaction of EC 1.1.1.36 is defined more generally as (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA + NADP+ = 3-oxoacyl-CoA + NADPH. Members of this family may act in the biosynthesis of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (e.g. Rhizobium meliloti) and related poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoates. Note that the member of this family from Azospirillum brasilense, designated NodG, appears to lack acetoacetyl-CoA reductase activity and to act instead in the production of nodulation factor. This family is downgraded to subfamily for this NodG. Other proteins designated NodG, as from Rhizobium, belong to related but distinct protein families.</td>

This subgroup also includes an SDR from Norway spruce that may function to protect against both biotic and abitoic stress.

This SDR subgroup has a classical Gly-rich NAD(P)-binding motif and a conserved active site tetrad pattern. However, it has been proposed that Arg104 (Streptococcus suis Ga5DH numbering), as well as an active site Ca2+, play a critical role in catalysis. In addition to Ga5DHs this subgroup contains Erwinia chrysanthemi KduD which is involved in pectin degradation, and is a putative 2,5-diketo-3-deoxygluconate dehydrogenase.

            <td id=al>cd05344 putative beta-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein [ACP] reductase (BKR)-like, SDR. This subgroup resembles the SDR family, but does not have a perfect match to the NAD-binding motif or the catalytic tetrad characteristic of the SDRs. It includes the SDRs, Q9HYA2 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and APE0912 from Aeropyrum pernix K1. BKR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ACP in the first reductive step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS). FAS consists of four elongation steps, which are repeated to extend the fatty acid chain through the addition of two-carbo units from malonyl acyl-carrier protein (ACP): condensation, reduction, dehydration, and a final reduction. Type II FAS, typical of plants and many bacteria, maintains these activities on discrete polypeptides, while type I FAS utilizes one or two multifunctional polypeptides. BKR resembles enoyl reductase, which catalyzes the second reduction step in FAS. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix motif that is not generally found among SDRs.</td>

This subgroup contains classical SDR proteins, including members identified as 1-cyclohexenylcarbonyl coenzyme A reductase. ChcA of Streptomyces collinus is implicated in the final reduction step of shikimic acid to ansatrienin. ChcA shows sequence similarity to the SDR family of NAD-binding proteins, but it lacks the conserved Tyr of the characteristic catalytic site. This subgroup also contains the NADH-dependent enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein(ACP)] reductase FabL from Bacillus subtilis. This enzyme participates in bacterial fatty acid synthesis, in type II fatty-acid synthases and catalyzes the last step in each elongation cycle. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

Included in this subgroup are Klebsiella pneumonia meso-BDH which catalyzes meso-2,3-butanediol to D(-)-acetonin, and Corynebacterium glutamicum L-BDH which catalyzes lX+)-2,3-butanediol to L(+)-acetonin. This subgroup is comprised of classical SDRs with the characteristic catalytic triad and NAD-binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05353 (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase-like, classical(c)-like SDRs. Beta oxidation of fatty acids in eukaryotes occurs by a four-reaction cycle, that may take place in mitochondria or in peroxisomes. (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is part of rat peroxisomal multifunctional MFE-2, it is a member of the NAD-dependent SDRs, but contains an additional small C-terminal domain that completes the active site pocket and participates in dimerization. The atypical, additional C-terminal extension allows for more extensive dimerization contact than other SDRs. MFE-2 catalyzes the second and third reactions of the peroxisomal beta oxidation cycle. Proteins in this subgroup have a typical catalytic triad, but have a His in place of the usual upstream Asn. This subgroup also contains members identified as 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, including human peroxisomal 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 (17beta-HSD type 4, aka MFE-2, encoded by HSD17B4 gene) which is involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation and steroid metabolism.

            <td id=al>cd08930 classical (c) SDR, subgroup 8. This subgroup has a fairly well conserved active site tetrad and domain size of the classical SDRs, but has an atypical NAD-binding motif ([ST]G[GA]XGXXG). SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05369 Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (TER) and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (DECR), atypical (a) SDR. TTER is a peroxisomal protein with a proposed role in fatty acid elongation. Fatty acid synthesis is known to occur in the both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria; peroxisomal TER has been proposed as an additional fatty acid elongation system, it reduces the double bond at C-2 as the last step of elongation.  This system resembles the mitochondrial system in that acetyl-CoA is used as a carbon donor. TER may also function in phytol metabolism, reducting phytenoyl-CoA to phytanoyl-CoA in peroxisomes. DECR processes double bonds in fatty acids to increase their utility in fatty acid metabolism; it reduces 2,4-dienoyl-CoA to an enoyl-CoA. DECR is active in mitochondria and peroxisomes. This subgroup has the Gly-rich NAD-binding motif of the classical SDR family, but does not display strong identity to the canonical active site tetrad, and lacks the characteristic Tyr at the usual position. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix motif that is not generally found among SDRs.</td>

The Escherichai coli K12 BKR, FabG, belongs to a different subgroup. BKR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ACP in the first reductive step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS). FAS consists of four elongation steps, which are repeated to extend the fatty acid chain through the addition of two-carbo units from malonyl acyl-carrier protein (ACP): condensation, reduction, dehydration, and a final reduction. Type II FAS, typical of plants and many bacteria, maintains these activities on discrete polypeptides, while type I FAS utilizes one or two multifunctional polypeptides. BKR resembles enoyl reductase, which catalyzes the second reduction step in FAS.

SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix motif that is not generally found among SDRs.</td>

This subgroup includes the putative Brucella melitensis biovar Abortus 2308 BKR, FabG, Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099 FabG, and other classical SDRs. BKR, a member of the SDR family, catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of acyl carrier protein in the first reductive step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS).  FAS consists of 4 elongation steps, which are repeated to extend the fatty acid chain thru the addition of two-carbo units from malonyl acyl-carrier protein (ACP): condensation, reduction, dehydration, and final reduction. Type II FAS, typical of plants and many bacteria, maintains these activities on discrete polypeptides, while type I Fas utilizes one or 2 multifunctional polypeptides. BKR resembles enoyl reductase, which catalyzes the second reduction step in FAS. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region.

            <td id=al>cd05371 17hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (HSD10)-like, classical (c) SDRs. HSD10, also known as amyloid-peptide-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), was previously identified as a L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, HADH2. In fatty acid metabolism, HADH2 catalyzes the third step of beta-oxidation, the conversion of a hydroxyl to a keto group in the NAD-dependent oxidation of L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA. In addition to alcohol dehydrogenase and HADH2 activites, HSD10 has steroid dehydrogenase activity. Although the mechanism is unclear, HSD10 is implicated in the formation of amyloid beta-petide in the brain (which is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease). Although HSD10 is normally concentrated in the mitochondria, in the presence of amyloid beta-peptide it translocates into the plasma membrane, where it's action may generate cytotoxic aldehydes and may lower estrogen levels through its use of 17-beta-estradiol as a substrate. HSD10 is a member of the SRD family, but differs from other SDRs by the presence of two insertions of unknown function. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

These are members of the classical SDR family, with a canonical Gly-rich  NAD-binding motif and the typical YXXXK active site motif. However, the rest of the catalytic tetrad is not strongly conserved. DHRS1 mRNA has been detected in many tissues, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas; a longer transcript is predominantly expressed in the liver , a shorter one in the heart. HSDL2 may play a part in fatty acid metabolism, as it is found in peroxisomes. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser).

These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix motif that is not generally found among SDRs.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05324 Porcine testicular carbonyl reductase (PTCR)-like, classical (c) SDRs. PTCR is a classical SDR which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ketones on steroids and prostaglandins. Unlike most SDRs, PTCR functions as a monomer. This subgroup also includes human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and CBR3. CBR1 is an NADPH-dependent SDR with broad substrate specificity and may be responsible for the in vivo reduction of quinones, prostaglandins, and other carbonyl-containing compounds. In addition it includes poppy NADPH-dependent salutaridine reductase which catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of salutaridine to 7(S)-salutaridinol in the biosynthesis of morphine, and Arabidopsis SDR1,a menthone reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of menthone to neomenthol, a compound with antimicrobial activity; SDR1  can also carry out neomenthol oxidation. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05360 classical (c) SDR, subgroup 3. These proteins are members of the classical SDR family, with a canonical active site triad (and also active site Asn) and a typical Gly-rich NAD-binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix motif that is not generally found among SDRs.</td>

This subgroup includes a putative carbohydrate or polyalcohol metabolizing SDR (A3DFK9) from Clostridium thermocellum. Its members have a TGXXXGXG classical-SDR glycine-rich NAD-binding motif, and some have a canonical SDR active site tetrad (A3DFK9 lacks the upstream Asn). SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08933 retinal dehydrogenase-like, classical (c) SDR. These classical SDRs includes members identified as retinol dehydrogenases, which convert retinol to retinal, a property that overlaps with 17betaHSD activity. 17beta-dehydrogenases are a group of isozymes that catalyze activation and inactivation of estrogen and androgens, and include members of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductase family. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd05325 carbonyl reductase sniffer-like, classical (c) SDRs. Sniffer is an NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase of the classical SDR family. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster implicate Sniffer in the prevention of neurodegeneration due to aging and oxidative-stress. This subgroup also includes Rhodococcus sp. AD45 IsoH, which is an NAD-dependent 1-hydroxy-2-glutathionyl-2-methyl-3-butene dehydrogenase involved in isoprene metabolism, Aspergillus nidulans StcE encoded by a gene which is part of a proposed sterigmatocystin biosynthesis gene cluster, Bacillus circulans SANK 72073 BtrF encoded by a gene found in the butirosin biosynthesis gene cluster, and Aspergillus parasiticus nor-1 involved in the biosynthesis of aflatoxins. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

These proteins are members of the classical SDR family, with a canonical active site triad (and also an active site Asn) and a typical Gly-rich NAD-binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser).

Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08953 ketoreductase (KR), subgroup 2, complex (x) SDRs. Ketoreductase, a module of the multidomain polyketide synthase (PKS), has 2 subdomains, each corresponding  to a SDR family monomer. The C-terminal subdomain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the beta-carbonyl of a polyketide to a hydroxyl group, a step in the biosynthesis of polyketides, such as erythromycin. The N-terminal subdomain, an interdomain linker, is a truncated Rossmann fold which acts to stabilizes the catalytic subdomain. Unlike typical SDRs, the isolated domain does not oligomerize but is composed of 2 subdomains, each resembling an SDR monomer. The active site resembles that of typical SDRs, except that the usual positions of the catalytic Asn and Tyr are swapped, so that the canonical YXXXK motif changes to YXXXN. Modular PKSs are multifunctional structures in which the makeup recapitulates that found in (and may have evolved from) FAS. Polyketide synthesis also proceeds via the addition of 2-carbon units as in fatty acid synthesis. The complex SDR NADP-binding motif, GGXGXXG, is often present, but is not strictly conserved in each instance of the module. This subfamily includes both KR domains of the Bacillus subtilis Pks J,-L, and PksM, and all three KR domains of PksN, components of the megacomplex bacillaene synthase, which synthesizes the antibiotic bacillaene. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity.

It converts dihydrobiopterin into tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor necessary in catecholamines synthesis. Dihydropteridine reductase has the YXXXK of these tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, but lacks the typical upstream Asn and Ser catalytic residues. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser).

Ketoreductase, a module of the multidomain polyketide synthase (PKS), has 2 subdomains, each corresponding  to a SDR family monomer. The C-terminal subdomain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the beta-carbonyl of a polyketide to a hydroxyl group, a step in the biosynthesis of polyketides, such as erythromycin. The N-terminal subdomain, an interdomain linker, is a truncated Rossmann fold which acts to stabilizes the catalytic subdomain. Unlike typical SDRs, the isolated domain does not oligomerize but is composed of 2 subdomains, each resembling an SDR monomer. The active site resembles that of typical SDRs, except that the usual positions of the catalytic Asn and Tyr are swapped, so that the canonical YXXXK motif changes to YXXXN. Modular PKSs are multifunctional structures in which the makeup recapitulates that found in (and may have evolved from) FAS.  In some instances, such as porcine FAS, an enoyl reductase (ER) module is inserted between the sub-domains. Fatty acid synthesis occurs via the stepwise elongation of a chain (which is attached to acyl carrier protein, ACP) with 2-carbon units. Eukaryotic systems consist of large, multifunctional synthases (type I) while bacterial, type II systems, use single function proteins. Fungal fatty acid synthase uses a dodecamer of 6 alpha and 6 beta subunits. In mammalian type FAS cycles, ketoacyl synthase forms acetoacetyl-ACP which is reduced by the NADP-dependent beta-KR, forming beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP, which is in turn dehydrated by dehydratase to a beta-enoyl intermediate, which is reduced by NADP-dependent beta-ER. Polyketide synthesis also proceeds via the addition of 2-carbon units as in fatty acid synthesis. The complex SDR NADP-binding motif, GGXGXXG, is often present, but is not strictly conserved in each instance of the module.

Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08955 beta-ketoacyl reductase (KR) domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS), subgroup 2, complex (x). Ketoreductase, a module of the multidomain polyketide synthase, has 2 subdomains, each corresponding  to a short-chain dehydrogenases/reductase (SDR) family monomer. The C-terminal subdomain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the beta-carbonyl of a polyketide to a hydroxyl group, a step in the biosynthesis of polyketides, such as erythromycin.  The N-terminal subdomain, an interdomain linker, is a truncated Rossmann fold which acts to stabilizes the catalytic subdomain. Unlike typical SDRs, the isolated domain does not oligomerizes but is composed of 2 subdomains, each resembling an SDR monomer.  In some instances,  as in porcine FAS, an enoyl reductase (a Rossman fold NAD binding domain of the MDR family) module is inserted between the sub-domains.  The active site resembles that of typical SDRs, except that the usual positions of the catalytic asparagine and tyrosine are swapped, so that the canonical YXXXK motif changes to YXXXN. Modular polyketide synthases are multifunctional structures in which the makeup recapitulates that found in (and may have evolved from) fatty acid synthase.   In some instances, such as porcine FAS , an enoyl reductase module is inserted between the sub-domains. Fatty acid synthesis occurs via the stepwise elongation of a chain (which is attached to acyl carrier protein, ACP) with 2-carbon units. Eukaryotic systems consists of large, multifunctional synthases (type I) while bacterial, type II systems, use single function proteins. Fungal fatty acid synthesis uses dodecamer of 6 alpha and 6 beta subunits. In mammalian type FAS cycles,  ketoacyl synthase forms acetoacetyl-ACP which is reduced by the NADP-dependent beta-ketoacyl reductase (KR), forming beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP, which is in turn dehydrated by dehydratase to a beta-enoyl intermediate, which is reduced by NADP-dependent beta-enoyl reductase (ER). Polyketide syntheses also proceeds via the addition of 2-carbon units as in fatty acid synthesis.  The complex SDR NADP binding motif, GGXGXXG, is often present, but is not strictly conserved in each instance of the module. This subfamily includes the KR domain of the Lyngbya majuscule Jam J, -K, and #L  which are encoded on the jam gene cluster and are involved in the synthesis of the Jamaicamides (neurotoxins); Lyngbya majuscule Jam P belongs to a different KR_FAS_SDR_x subfamily. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>
