            <td id=al>TenA_E proteins similar to Arabidopsis thaliana At3g16990. This family of TenA proteins belongs to the TenA_E class, and lacks the conserved active site Cys residue of the TenA_C class; most have a pair of structurally conserved Glu residues in the active site. TenA_C proteins (EC 3.5.99.2; aminopyrimidine aminohydrolase, also known as thiaminase II) catalyze the hydrolysis of the thiamin breakdown product 4-amino-5-amino-methyl-2-methylpyrimidine (amino-HMP) to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP) in a thiamin salvage pathway; the role of TenA_E proteins is less clear. Members of this family include Arabidopsis thaliana At3g16990, Zea mays GRMZM2G080501, and Pyrococcus furiosus PF1337, among others. Arabidopsis thaliana TenA_E hydrolyzes amino-HMP to AMP, and the N-formyl derivative of amino-HMP to amino-HMP, but does not hydrolyze thiamin; nor does it have activity with other thiamine degradation products such as thiamine mono- or diphosphate, oxythiamine, oxothiamine, thiamine disulfide, desthiothiamine or thiochrome as substrates. Structural studies of P. furiosus PF1337 strongly support its enzymatic function in thiamine biosynthesis. It has also been suggested that TenA proteins act as transcriptional regulators based on changes in gene-expression patterns when TenA is overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis, however this effect may be indirect.</td>

            <td id=al>TENA/THI-4/PQQC family. Members of this family are found in all the three major phyla of life: archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. In Bacillus subtilis, TENA is one of a number of proteins that enhance the expression of extracellular enzymes, such as alkaline protease, neutral protease and levansucrase. The THI-4 protein, which is involved in thiamine biosynthesis, is also a member of this family. The C-terminal part of these proteins consistently show significant sequence similarity to TENA proteins. This similarity was first noted with the Neurospora crassa THI-4. This family includes bacterial coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein C or PQQC proteins. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is the prosthetic group of several bacterial enzymes,including methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophs and the glucose dehydrogenase of a number of bacteria. PQQC has been found to be required in the synthesis of PQQ but its function is unclear. The exact molecular function of members of this family is uncertain.</td>

            <td id=al>TenA-like proteins including TenA_C and TenA_E proteins, as well as pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) synthesis protein C. TenA proteins participate in thiamin metabolism and can be classified into two classes: TenA_C which has an active site Cys, and TenA_E which does not; TenA_E proteins often have a pair of structurally conserved Glu residues in the active site. TenA_C proteins (EC 3.5.99.2) catalyze the hydrolysis of the thiamin breakdown product amino-HMP (4-amino-5-amino-methyl-2-methylpyrimidine) to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP) in a thiamin salvage pathway; the role of TenA_E proteins is less clear. Arabidopsis thaliana TenA_E hydrolyzes amino-HMP to AMP, and the N-formyl derivative of amino-HMP to amino-HMP, but does not hydrolyze thiamin. Bacillus subtilis TenA_C can hydrolyze amino-HMP to AMP and can catalyze the hydrolysis of thiamin. Saccharomyces cerevisiae THI20 includes a C-terminal tetrameric TenA-like domain fused to an N-terminal ThiD domain, and participates in thiamin biosynthesis, degradation and salvage; the TenA-like domain catalyzes the production of HMP from thiamin degradation products (salvage). Bacillus halodurans TenA_C participates in a salvage pathway where the thiamine degradation product 2-methyl-4-formylamino-5-aminomethylpyrimidine (formylamino-HMP) is hydrolyzed first to amino-HMP by the YlmB protein, and the amino-HMP is then hydrolyzed by TenA to produce HMP. Helicobacter pylori TenA_C is also thought to catalyze a salvage reaction but the pyrimidine substrate has not yet been identified. It has also been suggested that TenA proteins act as transcriptional regulators based on changes in gene-expression patterns when TenA is overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis, however this effect may be indirect; Pyrococcus furiosus TenA_E lacks appropriate surface charges for DNA interactions. This family also includes bacterial coenzyme pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) synthesis protein C (PQQC), an oxidase involved in the final step of PQQ biosynthesis, and CADD, a Chlamydia protein that interacts with death receptors.</td>

            <td id=al>TenA_E proteins similar to Streptococcus pneumoniae Spr0628 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C PET18. This family of TenA proteins belongs to the TenA_E class, and lacks the conserved active site Cys residue of the TenA_C class; most have a pair of structurally conserved Glu residues in the active site. TenA_C proteins (EC 3.5.99.2; aminopyrimidine aminohydrolase, also known as thiaminase II) catalyze the hydrolysis of the thiamin breakdown product 4-amino-5-amino-methyl-2-methylpyrimidine (amino-HMP) to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP) in a thiamin salvage pathway; the role of TenA_E proteins is less clear. Arabidopsis thaliana TenA_E (not belonging to this family) hydrolyzes amino-HMP to AMP, and the N-formyl derivative of amino-HMP to amino-HMP. Members of this family include the putative thiaminase Streptococcus pneumoniae Spr0628, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C PET18, a protein of unknown function whose expression is induced in the absence of thiamin. It has also been suggested that TenA proteins act as transcriptional regulators based on changes in gene-expression patterns when TenA is overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis, however this effect may be indirect. Many proteins in this family have yet to be characterized.</td>

This family of TenA proteins belongs to the TenA_C class as it has a conserved active site Cys residue; the double Glu residues identified in the active site of TenA_E from the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus is conserved in this family. TenA_C proteins (EC 3.5.99.2) catalyze the hydrolysis of the thiamin breakdown product 4-amino-5-amino-methyl-2-methylpyrimidine (amino-HMP) to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP) in a thiamin salvage pathway. It has also been suggested that TenA proteins act as transcriptional regulators based on changes in gene-expression patterns when TenA is overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis, however this effect may be indirect.

            <td id=al>TenA_C family similar to the C-terminal TenA_C domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae THI20 protein. This TenA family belongs to the TenA_C class as it has a conserved active site Cys residue; the double Glu residues identified in the active site of TenA_E from the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus is conserved in this family. TenA_C proteins (EC 3.5.99.2) catalyze the hydrolysis of the thiamin breakdown product 4-amino-5-amino-methyl-2-methylpyrimidine (amino-HMP) to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP) in a thiamin salvage pathway. Saccharomyces cerevisiae THI20 includes a C-terminal tetrameric TenA-like domain fused to an N-terminal HMP kinase/HMP-P kinase (ThiD-like) domain, and participates in thiamin biosynthesis, degradation and salvage; the TenA-like domain catalyzes the production of HMP from thiamin degradation products (salvage). A majority of this family are single-domain TenA_C- like proteins; some however have additional domains such as a ThiD domain. It has also been suggested that TenA proteins act as transcriptional regulators based on changes in gene-expression patterns when TenA is overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis, however this effect may be indirect.</td>
