The ABC transporter subfamily specific for the transport of dipeptides, oligopeptides (OppD), and nickel (NikDE). The NikABCDE system of E. coli belongs to this family and is composed of the periplasmic binding protein NikA, two integral membrane components (NikB and NikC), and two ATPase (NikD and NikE). The NikABCDE transporter is synthesized under anaerobic conditions to meet the increased demand for nickel resulting from hydrogenase synthesis. The molecular mechanism of nickel uptake in many bacteria and most archaea is not known. Many other members of this ABC family are also involved in the uptake of dipeptides and oligopeptides. The oligopeptide transport system (Opp) is a five-component ABC transport composed of a membrane-anchored substrate binding proteins (SRP), OppA, two transmembrane proteins, OppB and OppC, and two ATP-binding domains, OppD and OppF.</td>

HisP and GlnQ are the ATP-binding components of the bacterial periplasmic histidine and glutamine permeases, respectively. Histidine permease is a multi-subunit complex containing the HisQ and HisM integral membrane subunits and two copies of HisP. HisP has properties intermediate between those of integral and peripheral membrane proteins and is accessible from both sides of the membrane, presumably by its interaction with HisQ and HisM. The two HisP subunits form a homodimer within the complex. The domain structure of the amino acid uptake systems is typical for prokaryotic extracellular solute binding protein-dependent uptake systems. All of the amino acid uptake systems also have at least one, and in a few cases, two extracellular solute binding proteins located in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, or attached to the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. The best-studied member of the PAAT (polar amino acid transport) family is the HisJQMP system of S. typhimurium, where HisJ is the extracellular solute binding proteins and HisP is the ABC protein.</td>

An FtsE null mutants showed filamentous growth and appeared viable on high salt medium only, indicating a role for FtsE in cell division and/or salt transport.

PstB is the catalytic subunit, which couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the import of phosphate across cellular membranes through the Pst system, often referred as ABC-protein.

The two ATP-binding cassettes (BtuD) are in close contact with each other, as are the two membrane-spanning subunits (BtuC); this arrangement is distinct from that observed for the E. coli lipid flippase MsbA. The BtuC subunits provide 20 transmembrane helices grouped around a translocation pathway that is closed to the cytoplasm by a gate region, whereas the dimer arrangement of the BtuD subunits resembles the ATP-bound form of the Rad50 DNA repair enzyme. A prominent cytoplasmic loop of BtuC forms the contact region with the ATP-binding cassette and represent a conserved motif among the ABC transporters.</td>

NatB possess six putative membrane spanning regions at its C-terminus. In B. subtilis, NatAB is inducible by agents such as ethanol and protonophores, which lower the proton-motive force across the membrane. The closest sequence similarity to NatA is exhibited by DrrA of the two-component daunorubicin- and doxorubicin-efflux system. Hence, the functional NatAB is presumably assembled with two copies of a single ATP-binding protein and a single integral membrane protein.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03224 ATP-binding cassette domain of branched-chain amino acid transporter. LivF (TM1139) is part of the LIV-I bacterial ABC-type two-component transport system that imports neutral, branched-chain amino acids. The E. coli branched-chain amino acid transporter comprises a heterodimer of ABC transporters (LivF and LivG), a heterodimer of six-helix TM domains (LivM and LivH), and one of two alternative soluble periplasmic substrate binding proteins (LivK or LivJ). ABC transporters are a large family of proteins involved in the transport of a wide variety of different compounds, like sugars, ions, peptides, and more complex organic molecules.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03228 ATP-binding cassette domain of multidrug resistance protein-like transporters. The MRP (Multidrug Resistance Protein)-like transporters are involved in drug, peptide, and lipid export. They belong to the subfamily C of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins. The ABCC subfamily contains transporters with a diverse functional spectrum that includes ion transport, cell surface receptor, and toxin secretion activities. The MRP-like family, similar to all ABC proteins, have a common four-domain core structure constituted by two membrane-spanning domains, each composed of six transmembrane (TM) helices, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD). ABC transporters are a subset of nucleotide hydrolases that contain a signature motif, Q-loop, and H-loop/switch region, in addition to, the Walker A motif/P-loop and Walker B motif commonly found in a number of ATP- and GTP-binding and hydrolyzing proteins.</td>

The Carb_Monos family is involved in the uptake of monosaccharides, such as pentoses (such as xylose, arabinose, and ribose) and hexoses (such as xylose, arabinose, and ribose), that cannot be broken down to simple sugars by hydrolysis. Pentoses include xylose, arabinose, and ribose. Important hexoses include glucose, galactose, and fructose. In members of the Carb_monos family, the single hydrophobic gene product forms a homodimer while the ABC protein represents a fusion of two nucleotide-binding domains. However, it is assumed that two copies of the ABC domains are present in the assembled transporter.</td>

The genes yhbG and yhbN are located in a single operon and may function together in cell envelope during biogenesis. YhbG is the putative ATP-binding cassette component and YhbN is the putative periplasmic-binding protein. Depletion of each gene product leads to growth arrest, irreversible cell damage and loss of viability in E. coli. The YhbG homolog (NtrA) is essential in Rhizobium meliloti, a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium.</td>

Domain II of the ABC component of a cobalt transport family found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota. The transition metal cobalt is an essential component of many enzymes and must be transported into cells in appropriate amounts when needed. The CbiMNQO family ABC transport system is involved in cobalt transport in association with the cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthetic pathways. Most cobalt (Cbi) transport systems possess a separate CbiN component, the cobalt-binding periplasmic protein, and they are encoded by the conserved gene cluster cbiMNQO. Both the CbiM and CbiQ proteins are integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins, and the CbiO protein has the linker peptide and the Walker A and B motifs commonly found in the ATPase components of the ABC-type transport systems.</td>

Several gene products encoded in a locus designated as 'ccm' are implicated in the transport and assembly of the functional cytochrome C. This cluster includes genes: ccmA;B;C;D;E;F;G and H. The posttranslational pathway includes the transport of heme moiety, the secretion of the apoprotein and the covalent attachment of the heme with the apoprotein. The proteins ccmA and B represent an ABC transporter; ccmC and D participate in heme transfer to ccmE, which function as a periplasmic heme chaperone. The presence of ccmF, G and H is suggested to be obligatory for the final functional assembly of cytochrome c.

The gene pair cydCD encodes an ABC-family transporter in which each gene contains an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain (pfam00664) and a C-terminal ATP-binding domain (pfam00005). In E. coli these genes were discovered as mutants which caused the terminal heme-copper oxidase complex cytochrome bd to fail to assemble. Recent work has shown that the transporter is involved in export of redox-active thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione. The linkage to assembly of the cytochrome bd complex is further supported by the conserved operon structure found outside the gammaproteobacteria (cydABCD) containing both the transporter and oxidase genes components. The genes used as the seed members for this model are all either found in the gammproteobacterial context or the CydABCD context. All members of this family scoring above trusted at the time of its creation were from genomes which encode a cytochrome bd complex. Unfortunately, the gene symbol nomenclature adopted based on this operon in B. subtilis assigns cydC to the third gene in the operon where this gene is actually homologous to the E. coli cydD gene. We have chosen to name all homologs in this family in accordance with the precedence of publication of the E. coli name, CydD</td>

In fact, the yeast MDL1 (multidrug resistance-like protein 1) and MDL2 (multidrug resistance-like protein 2) transporters are also included in this CD. MDL1 is an ATP-dependent permease that acts as a high-copy suppressor of ATM1 and is thought to have a role in resistance to oxidative stress.

NatB possess six putative membrane spanning regions at its C-terminus. In B. subtilis, NatAB is inducible by agents such as ethanol and protonophores, which lower the proton-motive force across the membrane. The closest sequence similarity to NatA is exhibited by DrrA of the two-component daunorubicin- and doxorubicin-efflux system. Hence, the functional NatAB is presumably assembled with two copies of the single ATP-binding protein and the single integral membrane protein.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03234 White pigment protein homolog of ABCG transporter subfamily. The White subfamily represents ABC transporters homologous to the Drosophila white gene, which acts as a dimeric importer for eye pigment precursors. The eye pigmentation of Drosophila is developed from the synthesis and deposition in the cells of red pigments, which are synthesized from guanine, and brown pigments, which are synthesized from tryptophan. The pigment precursors are encoded by the white, brown, and scarlet genes, respectively. Evidence from genetic and biochemical studies suggest that the White and Brown proteins function as heterodimers to import guanine, while the White and Scarlet proteins function to import tryptophan. However, a recent study also suggests that White may be involved in the transport of a metabolite, such as 3-hydroxykynurenine, across intracellular membranes. Mammalian ABC transporters belonging to the White subfamily (ABCG1, ABCG5, and ABCG8) have been shown to be involved in the regulation of lipid-trafficking mechanisms in macrophages, hepatocytes, and intestinal mucosa cells. ABCG1 (ABC8), the human homolog of the Drosophila white gene is induced in monocyte-derived macrophages during cholesterol influx mediated by acetylated low-density lipoprotein. It is possible that human ABCG1 forms heterodimers with several heterologous partners.</td>

The CCM family is involved in bacterial cytochrome c biogenesis. Cytochrome c maturation in E. coli requires the ccm operon, which encodes eight membrane proteins (CcmABCDEFGH). CcmE is a periplasmic heme chaperon that binds heme covalently and transfers it onto apocytochrome c in the presence of CcmF, CcmG, and CcmH. The CcmAB proteins represent an ABC transporter and the CcmCD proteins participate in heme transfer to CcmE.</td>

The gene pair cydCD encodes an ABC-family transporter in which each gene contains an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain (pfam00664) and a C-terminal ATP-binding domain (pfam00005). In E. coli these genes were discovered as mutants which caused the terminal heme-copper oxidase complex cytochrome bd to fail to assemble. Recent work has shown that the transporter is involved in export of redox-active thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione. The linkage to assembly of the cytochrome bd complex is further supported by the conserved operon structure found outside the gammaproteobacteria (cydABCD) containing both the transporter and oxidase genes components. The genes used as the seed members for this model are all either found in the gammproteobacterial context or the CydABCD context. All members of this family scoring above trusted at the time of its creation were from genomes which encode a cytochrome bd complex.</td>

This family represents the ABC component of the protease secretion system PrtD, a 60-kDa integral membrane protein sharing 37% identity with HlyB, the ABC component of the alpha-hemolysin secretion pathway, in the C-terminal domain. They export degradative enzymes by using a type I protein secretion system and lack an N-terminal signal peptide, but contain a C-terminal secretion signal. The Type I secretion apparatus is made up of three components, an ABC transporter, a membrane fusion protein (MFP), and an outer membrane protein (OMP). For the HlyA transporter complex, HlyB (ABC transporter) and HlyD (MFP) reside in the inner membrane of E. coli. The OMP component is TolC, which is thought to interact with the MFP to form a continuous channel across the periplasm from the cytoplasm to the exterior. HlyB belongs to the family of ABC transporters, which are ubiquitous, ATP-dependent transmembrane pumps or channels. The spectrum of transport substrates ranges from inorganic ions, nutrients such as amino acids, sugars, or peptides, hydrophobic drugs, to large polypeptides, such as HlyA.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03252 ATP-binding cassette domain of hemolysin B, subfamily C. The ABC-transporter hemolysin B is a central component of the secretion machinery that translocates the toxin, hemolysin A, in a Sec-independent fashion across both membranes of E. coli. The hemolysin A (HlyA) transport machinery is composed of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter HlyB located in the inner membrane, hemolysin D (HlyD), also anchored in the inner membrane, and TolC, which resides in the outer membrane. HlyD apparently forms a continuous channel that bridges the entire periplasm, interacting with TolC and HlyB. This arrangement prevents the appearance of periplasmic intermediates of HlyA during substrate transport. Little is known about the molecular details of HlyA transport, but it is evident that ATP-hydrolysis by the ABC-transporter HlyB is a necessary source of energy.</td>

CydCD were proposed to determine a heterooligomeric complex important for heme export into the periplasm or to be involved in the maintenance of the proper redox state of the periplasmic space. In Bacillus subtilis, the absence of CydCD does not affect the presence of halo-cytochrome c in the membrane and this observation suggests that CydCD proteins are not involved in the export of heme in this organism.</td>

Peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette transporter (Pat) is involved in the import of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) into the peroxisome. The peroxisomal membrane forms a permeability barrier for a wide variety of metabolites required for and formed during fatty acid beta-oxidation. To communicate with the cytoplasm and mitochondria, peroxisomes need dedicated proteins to transport such hydrophilic molecules across their membranes. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is caused by mutations in the ALD gene, which encodes ALDP (adrenoleukodystrophy protein ), a peroxisomal integral membrane protein that is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family. The disease is characterized by a striking and unpredictable variation in phenotypic expression. Phenotypes include the rapidly progressive childhood cerebral form (CCALD), the milder adult form, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), and variants without neurologic involvement (i.e. asymptomatic).</td>

Unlike other ABC proteins, it has no intrinsic transport function, neither active nor passive, but associates with the potassium channel proteins Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 to form the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel. Within the channel complex, SUR serves as a regulatory subunit that fine-tunes the gating of Kir6.x in response to alterations in cellular metabolism. It constitutes a major pharmaceutical target as it binds numerous drugs, K(ATP) channel openers and blockers, capable of up- or down-regulating channel activity.</td>

Use of the term assembly of a functional ion channel implies the coming together of subunits, or at least smaller not-yet functional components of the active whole. In fact, on the basis of current knowledge only the CFTR polypeptide itself is required to form an ATP- and protein kinase A-dependent low-conductance chloride channel of the type present in the apical membrane of many epithelial cells. CFTR displays the typical organization (IM-ABC)2 and carries a characteristic hydrophilic R-domain that separates IM1-ABC1 from IM2-ABC2.</td>
