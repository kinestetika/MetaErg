            <td id=al>iduronate-2-sulfatase. Iduronate 2-sulfatase is a sulfatase enzyme that catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate ester bonds from a wide variety of substrates, including steroids, carbohydrates and proteins. Iduronate 2-sulfatase is required for the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Mutations in the iduronate 2-sulfatase gene that result in enzymatic deficiency lead to the sex-linked mucopolysaccharidosis type II, also known as Hunter syndrome.</td>

            <td id=al>sulfatase. Sulfatases catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate esters from wide range of substrates, including steroids, carbohydrates and proteins. Sulfate esters may be formed from various alcohols and amines. The biological roles of sulfatase includes the cycling of sulfur in the environment, in the degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids in the lysosome, and in remodeling sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular space. The sulfatases are essential for human metabolism. At least eight human monogenic diseases are caused by the deficiency of individual sulfatases.</td>

            <td id=al>N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (SGSH; sulfamidase). N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (SGSH) belongs to the sulfatase family and catalyses the cleavage of N-linked sulfate groups from the GAGs heparin sulfate and heparin. The active site is characterized by the amino-acid sequence motif C(X)PSR that is highly conserved among most sulfatases. The cysteine residue is post-translationally converted to a formylglycine (FGly) residue, which is crucial for the catalytic process. Loss of function of SGSH results a disease called mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (Sanfilippo A syndrome), a fatal childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease with mild facial, visceral and skeletal abnormalities.</td>

N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase also known as glucosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase hydrolyzes of the 6-sulfate groups of the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-sulfate units of heparan sulfate and keratan sulfate. Deficient of N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase results in disease of Sanfilippo Syndrome type IIId or Mucopolysaccharidosis III (MPS-III), a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease. SULF1 encodes an extracellular heparan sulfate endosulfatase, that removes 6-O-sulfate groups from heparan sulfate chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs).</td>

            <td id=al>galactosamine-6-sulfatase; also known as N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS). Lysosomal galactosamine-6-sulfatase removes sulfate groups from a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate (or galactose-6-sulfate) in mucopolysaccharides such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate. Defects in GALNS lead to accumulation of substrates, resulting in the development of the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis IV A.</td>

            <td id=al>Bacterial Arylsulfatase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and related proteins. Sulfatases catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate esters from wide range of substrates, including steroids, carbohydrates and proteins. Sulfate esters may be formed from various alcohols and amines. The biological roles of sulfatase includes the cycling of sulfur in the environment, in the degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids in the lysosome, and in remodeling sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular space. The sulfatases are essential for human metabolism. At least eight human monogenic diseases are caused by the deficiency of individual sulfatases.</td>

            <td id=al>Arylsulfatase A or cerebroside-sulfatase. Arylsulfatase A breaks down sulfatides, namely cerebroside 3-sulfate into cerebroside and sulfate. It is a member of the sulfatase family. The arylsulfatase A was located in lysosome-like structures and transported to dense lysosomes in a mannose 6-phosphate receptor-dependent manner. Deficiency of arylsulfatase A leads to the accumulation of cerebroside sulfate, which causes a lethal progressive demyelination. Arylsulfatase A requires the posttranslational oxidation of the -CH2SH group of a conserved cysteine to an aldehyde, yielding a formylglycine to be in an active form.</td>

            <td id=al>Estrone sulfatase. Human estrone sulfatase (ES) is responsible for maintaining high levels of the active estrogen in tumor cells. ES catalyzes the hydrolysis of E1 sulfate, which is a component of the three-enzyme system that has been implicated in intracrine biosynthesis of estradiol. It is associated with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The structure of ES consisting of two antiparallel alpha helices that protrude from the roughly spherical molecule. These highly hydrophobic helices anchor the functional domain on the membrane surface facing the ER lumen.</td>

            <td id=al>arylsulfatase G. Arylsulfatase G is a subfamily of sulfatases which specifically hydrolyze sulfate esters in a wide variety of substrates such as glycosaminoglycans, steroid sulfates, or sulfolipids. ARSG has arylsulfatase activity toward different pseudosubstrates like p-nitrocatechol sulfate and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. An active site Cys is post-translationally converted to the critical active site C(alpha)-formylglycine. ARSG mRNA expression was found to be tissue-specific with highest expression in liver, kidney, and pancreas, suggesting a metabolic role of ARSG that might be associated with a non-classified lysosomal storage disorder.</td>
