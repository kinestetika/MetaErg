            <td id=al>phosphoglucosamine mutase. The MMP1680 protein from Methanococcus maripaludis has been characterized as the archaeal protein responsible for the second step of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis. This GlmM protein catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate. The first-characterized bacterial GlmM protein is modeled by TIGR01455. These two families are members of the larger phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase family (characterized by three domains: pfam02878, pfam02879 and pfam02880), but are not nearest neighbors to each other. This model also includes a number of sequences from non-archaea in the Bacteroides, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes lineages. Evidence supporting their inclusion in this equivalog as having the same activity comes from genomic context and phylogenetic profiling. A large number of these organisms are known to produce exo-polysaccharide and yet only appeared to contain the GlmS enzyme of the GlmSMU pathway for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (GenProp0750). In some organisms including Leptospira, this archaeal GlmM is found adjacent to the GlmS as well as a putative GlmU non-orthologous homolog. Phylogenetic profiling of the GlmS-only pattern using PPP identifies members of this archaeal GlmM family as the highest-scoring result. [Central intermediary metabolism, Amino sugars]</td>

            <td id=al>The phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM) bifunctional enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of 1-phospho to 6-phospho-sugars (e.g. between mannose-1-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphate or glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate) via a bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate. The reaction involves two phosphoryl transfers, with an intervening 180 degree reorientation of the reaction intermediate during catalysis. Reorientation of the intermediate occurs without dissociation from the active site of the enzyme and is thus, a simple example of processivity, as defined by multiple rounds of catalysis without release of substrate. Glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate are known to be utilized for energy metabolism and cell surface construction, respectively. PMM/PGM belongs to the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily which includes several related enzymes that catalyze a reversible intramolecular phosphoryl transfer on their sugar substrates.

            <td id=al>This CD includes PGM2 (phosphoglucomutase 2) and PGM2L1 (phosphoglucomutase 2-like 1). The mammalian PGM2 is thought to be a phosphopentomutase that catalyzes the conversion of the nucleoside breakdown products, ribose-1-phosphate and deoxyribose-1-phosphate to the corresponding 5-phosphopentoses. PGM2L1 is thought to catalyze the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent synthesis of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and other aldose-bisphosphates that serve as cofactors for several sugar phosphomutases and possibly also as regulators of glycolytic enzymes.

            <td id=al>GlmM is a bacterial phosphoglucosamine mutase (PNGM) that belongs to the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily. It is required for the interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate and glucosamine-1-phosphate in the biosynthetic pathway of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, an essential precursor to components of the cell envelope.  In order to be active, GlmM must be phosphorylated, which can occur via autophosphorylation or by the Ser/Thr kinase StkP. GlmM functions in a classical ping-pong bi-bi mechanism with glucosamine-1,6-diphosphate as an intermediate.  Other members of the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily include phosphoglucosamine mutase (PNGM), phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PAGM), the bacterial phosphomannomutase ManB, and the bifunctional phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM).

            <td id=al>Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) catalyzes the bidirectional interconversion of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) via a glucose 1,6-diphosphate intermediate, an important metabolic step in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In one direction, G-1-P produced from sucrose catabolism is converted to G-6-P, the first intermediate in glycolysis. In the other direction, conversion of G-6-P to G-1-P generates a substrate for synthesis of UDP-glucose which is required for synthesis of a variety of cellular constituents including cell wall polymers and glycoproteins. The PGM1 family also includes a non-enzymatic PGM-related protein (PGM-RP) thought to play a structural role in eukaryotes, as well as pp63/parafusin, a phosphoglycoprotein that plays an important role in calcium-regulated exocytosis in ciliated protozoans.

            <td id=al>GTP-mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase (MPG1 transferase), also known as GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, is a bifunctional enzyme with both phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) activity and GDP-mannose phosphorylase (GMP) activity.  The protein contains an N-terminal NTP transferase domain, an L-beta-H domain, and a C-terminal PGM-like domain that belongs to the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily.  This subfamily is limited to bacteria and archaea. The alpha-D-phosphohexomutases include several related enzymes that catalyze a reversible intramolecular phosphoryl transfer on their sugar substrates. Members of this group appear to lack conserved residues necessary for metal binding and catalytic activity. Other members of this superfamily include the phosphoglucomutases (PGM1 and PGM2), phosphoglucosamine mutase (PNGM), phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PAGM), the bacterial phosphomannomutase ManB, the bacterial phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM, and the bifunctional phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM). Each of these enzymes has four domains with a centrally located active site formed by four loops, one from each domain. All four domains are included in this alignment model.</td>

            <td id=al>ManB is a bacterial phosphomannomutase (PMM) that catalyzes the conversion of mannose 6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate in the second of three steps in the GDP-mannose pathway, in which GDP-D-mannose is synthesized from fructose-6-phosphate. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, PMM is involved in the biosynthesis of mannosylated lipoglycans that participate in the association of mycobacteria with host macrophage phagocytic receptors. ManB belongs to the the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase superfamily which includes several related enzymes that catalyze a reversible intramolecular phosphoryl transfer on their sugar substrates. Other members of this superfamily include the phosphoglucomutases (PGM1 and PGM2), phosphoglucosamine mutase (PNGM), phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PAGM), the bacterial phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM, and the bifunctional phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM).
