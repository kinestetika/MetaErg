            <td id=al>This subfamily contains Escherichia coli WecA, Bacillus subtilis TagO and related proteins. WecA is an UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc):undecaprenyl-phosphate (Und-P) GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase that catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester bond between a membrane-associated undecaprenyl-phosphate molecule and N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate, which is usually donated by a soluble UDP-N-acetylglucosamine precursor. WecA participates in the biosynthesis of O antigen LPS in many enteric bacteria and is also involved in the biosynthesis of enterobacterial common antigen. A conserved short sequence motif and a conserved arginine at a cytosolic loop of this integral membrane protein were shown to be critical in recognition of substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.</td>

            <td id=al>The members of this subfamily catalyze the formation of a phosphodiester bond between a membrane-associated undecaprenyl-phosphate (Und-P) molecule and N-acetylhexosamine 1-phosphate, which is usually donated by a soluble UDP-N-acetylhexosamine precursor. The WbcO/WbpL substrate specificity has not yet been determined, but the structure of their biosynthetic end products implies that UDP-N-acetyl-D-fucosamine (UDP-FucNAc) and/or UDPN-acetyl-D-quinosamine (UDP-QuiNAc) are used. The subgroup of bacterial UDP-HexNAc:polyprenol-P HexNAc-1-P transferases includes the WbcO protein from Yersinia enterocolitica and the WbpL protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These transferases initiate LPS O-antigen biosynthesis. Similar to other GlcNAc/MurNAc-1-P transferase family members, WbpL is a highly hydrophobic protein possessing 11 predicted transmembrane segments.</td>

            <td id=al>This subfamily is composed of uncharacterized bacterial glycosyltransferases in the MraY-like family. This family contains both eukaryotic and prokaryotic UDP-D-N-acetylhexosamine:polyprenol phosphate D-N-acetylhexosamine-1-phosphate transferases, which catalyze the transfer of a D-N-acetylhexosamine 1-phosphate to a membrane-bound polyprenol phosphate. This is the initiation step of protein N-glycosylation in eukaryotes and peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria. The three bacterial members MraY, WecA, and WbpL/WbcO, utilize undecaprenol phosphate as the acceptor substrate, but use different UDP-sugar donor substrates. MraY-type transferases are highly specific for UDP-N-acetylmuramate-pentapeptide, whereas WecA proteins are selective for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). The WbcO/WbpL substrate specificity has not yet been determined, but the structure of their biosynthetic end products implies that UDP-N-acetyl-D-fucosamine (UDP-FucNAc) and/or UDPN-acetyl-D-quinosamine (UDP-QuiNAc) are used. The prokaryotic enzyme-catalyzed reactions lead to the formation of polyprenol-linked oligosaccharides involved in bacterial cell wall and peptidoglycan assembly.</td>

Members of this family are the WecA enzyme of enterobacterial common antigen biosynthesis, undecaprenyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphatetransferase. This family represents one narrow clade, and closely related sequences outside this clade may represent enzymes that catalyze the same specific reaction, but in the context of different pathways. A His-rich motif in a cytosolic loop of this integral membrane protein, shown critical to enzymatic activity for WecA is variously present or absent in the clade that includes Bacillus subtilis TagO teichoic acid biosynthesis enzyme, which may catalyze the same reaction as WecA.

            <td id=al>Glycosyltransferase 4 (GT4) includes both eukaryotic and prokaryotic UDP-D-N-acetylhexosamine:polyprenol phosphate D-N-acetylhexosamine-1-phosphate transferases. They catalyze the transfer of a D-N-acetylhexosamine 1-phosphate to a membrane-bound polyprenol phosphate, which is the initiation step of protein N-glycosylation in eukaryotes and peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria. One member, D-N-acetylhexosamine 1-phosphate transferase (GPT) is a eukaryotic enzyme, which is specific for UDP-GlcNAc as donor substrate and dolichol-phosphate as the membrane bound acceptor. The bacterial members MraY, WecA, and WbpL/WbcO utilize undecaprenol phosphate as the acceptor substrate, but use different UDP-sugar donor substrates. MraY-type transferases are highly specific for UDP-N-acetylmuramate-pentapeptide, whereas WecA proteins are selective for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). The WbcO/WbpL substrate specificity has not yet been determined, but the structure of their biosynthetic endproducts implies that UDP-N-acetyl-D-fucosamine (UDP-FucNAc) and/or UDPN-acetyl-D-quinosamine (UDP-QuiNAc) are used. The eukaryotic reaction is the first step in the assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide intermediates and is essential for N-glycosylation. The prokaryotic reactions lead to the formation of polyprenol-linked oligosaccharides involved in bacterial cell wall and peptidoglycan assembly. Archaeal and eukaryotic enzymes may use the same substrates and are evolutionarily closer than the bacterial enzyme. Archaea possess the same N-glycosylation pathway as eukaryotes. A glycosyl transferase gene Mv1751 in M. voltae encodes for the enzyme that carries out the first step in the pathway, the attachment of GlcNAc to a dolichol lipid carrier in the membrane. A lethal mutation in the alg7 (GPT) gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was successfully complemented with Mv1751, the archaea gene.</td>

The reaction is the first step in the assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide intermediates and is essential for eukaryotic N-linked glycosylation. Evidence for the existence of the N-glycosylation pathway in archaea has emerged and genes responsible for the pathway have been identified.
