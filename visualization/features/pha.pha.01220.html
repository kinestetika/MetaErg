            <td id=al>SpoIVFB Site-2 protease (S2P), a zinc metalloprotease (MEROPS family M50B), regulates intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), and is involved in the pro-sigmaK pathway of bacterial spore formation. In this subgroup, SpoIVFB (sporulation protein, stage IV cell wall formation, F locus, promoter-distal B) contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domain. SpoIVFB is one of 4 proteins involved in endospore formation; the others are SpoIVFA (sporulation protein, stage IV cell wall formation, F locus, promoter-proximal A), BofA (bypass-of-forespore A), and SpoIVB (sporulation protein, stage IV cell wall formation, B locus). SpoIVFB is negatively regulated by SpoIVFA and BofA and activated by SpoIVB. It is thought that SpoIVFB, SpoIVFA, and BofA are located in the mother-cell membrane that surrounds the forespore and that SpoIVB is secreted from the forespore into the space between the two where it activates SpoIVFB. It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown.</td>

            <td id=al>Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains found in the metalloprotease peptidase M50. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in peptidase M50.  Members of the M50 metallopeptidase family include mammalian sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) site 2 proteases and various hypothetical bacterial homologues. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>Site-2 protease (S2P) class of zinc metalloproteases (MEROPS family M50) cleaves transmembrane domains of substrate proteins, regulating intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of diverse signal transduction mechanisms. Members of this family use proteolytic activity within the membrane to transfer information across membranes to integrate gene expression with physiologic stresses occurring in another cellular compartment. The domain core structure appears to contain at least three transmembrane helices with a catalytic zinc atom coordinated by three conserved residues contained within the consensus sequence HExxH, together with a conserved aspartate residue. The S2P/M50 family of RIP proteases is widely distributed; in eukaryotic cells, they regulate such processes as sterol and lipid metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. In sterol-depleted mammalian cells, a two-step proteolytic process releases the N-terminal domains of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from membranes of the ER. These domains translocate into the nucleus, where they activate genes of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. It is the second proteolytic step that is carried out by the SREBP Site-2 protease (S2P) which is present in this CD superfamily. Prokaryotic S2P/M50 homologs have been shown to regulate stress responses, sporulation, cell division, and cell differentiation. In Escherichia coli, the S2P homolog RseP is involved in the sigmaE pathway of extracytoplasmic stress responses, and in Bacillus subtilis, the S2P homolog SpoIVFB is involved in the pro-sigmaK pathway of spore formation. Some of the subfamilies within this hierarchy contain one or two PDZ domain insertions, with putative regulatory roles, such as the inhibition of substrate cleavage as seen by the RseP PDZ domain.</td>

In prokaryotes they regulate such processes as sporulation, cell division, stress response, and cell differentiation.

Also included in this group are such homologs as Bacillus subtilis YluC, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2869c S2P, and Bordetella bronchiseptica HurP.  Rv2869c S2P appears to have a role in the regulation of prokaryotic lipid biosynthesis and membrane composition and YluC of Bacillus has a role in transducing membrane stress. This group includes bacterial and eukaryotic S2P/M50s homologs with either one or two PDZ domains present. PDZ domains are believed to have a regulatory role. The RseP PDZ domain is required for the inhibitory reaction that prevents cleavage of its substrate, RseA.</td>
