            <td id=al>cd19520 ATPase domain of ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 1 and similar ATPase domains. ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 1 (ATAD1, also known as Thorase) is an ATPase that plays a critical role in regulating the surface expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, thereby regulating synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. This subfamily belongs to the RecA-like NTPase family which includes the NTP binding domain of F1 and V1 H(+)ATPases, DnaB and related helicases as well as bacterial RecA and related eukaryotic and archaeal recombinases. The RecA-like NTPase family also includes bacterial conjugation proteins and related DNA transfer proteins involved in type II and type IV secretion.</td>

            <td id=al>cd19502 proteasome activating nucleotidase PAN and related proteasome subunits. This subfamily contains ATPase subunits of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome, and of the archaeal proteasome which carry out ATP-dependent degradation of substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The eukaryotic 26S proteasome consists of a proteolytic 20S core particle (CP), and a 19S regulatory particle (RP) which provides the ATP-dependence and the specificity for ubiquitinated proteins.  In the archaea the RP is a homohexameric complex of proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN). This subfamily also includes various eukaryotic 26S subunits including, proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 2 (PSMC2, also known as S7 and MSS1) which is a member of the 19S RP and has a chaperone like activity; and proteasome 20S subunit alpha 6 (PSMA6, also known as IOTA, p27K, and PROS27) which is a member of the 20S CP. This RecA-like_PAN subfamily belongs to the RecA-like NTPase family which includes the NTP binding domain of F1 and V1 H(+)ATPases, DnaB and related helicases as well as bacterial RecA and related eukaryotic and archaeal recombinases. The RecA-like NTPase family also includes bacterial conjugation proteins and related DNA transfer proteins involved in type II and type IV secretion.</td>

            <td id=al>cd19525 ATPase domain of Fidgetin-Like 1 (FIGL-1). FIGL-1 may participate in DNA repair in the nucleus; it may be involved in DNA double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. Caenorhabditis elegans FIGL-1 is a nuclear protein and controls the mitotic progression in the germ line and mouse FIGL-1 may be involved in the control of male meiosis. human FIGL-1 has been shown to be a centrosome protein involved in ciliogenesis perhaps as a microtubule-severing protein.
