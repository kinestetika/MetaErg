            <td id=al>cd03510 This CD includes the dihydrorhizobitoxine fatty acid desaturase (RtxC) characterized in Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110, and other related proteins. Dihydrorhizobitoxine desaturase is reported to be involved in the final step of rhizobitoxine biosynthesis. This domain family appears to be structurally related to the membrane fatty acid desaturases and the alkane hydroxylases. They all share in common extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of sequences also reveals the existence of three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXXH, HXX(X)HH, and HXXHH. These histidine residues are reported to be catalytically essential and proposed to be the ligands for the iron atoms contained within homologs, stearoyl CoA desaturase and alkane hydroxylase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01060 The membrane fatty acid desaturase (Membrane_FADS)-like CD includes membrane FADSs, alkane hydroxylases, beta carotene ketolases (CrtW-like), hydroxylases (CrtR-like), and other related proteins. They are present in all groups of organisms with the exception of archaea. Membrane FADSs are non-heme, iron-containing, oxygen-dependent enzymes involved in regioselective introduction of double bonds in fatty acyl aliphatic chains. They play an important role in the maintenance of the proper structure and functioning of biological membranes. Alkane hydroxylases are bacterial, integral-membrane di-iron enzymes that share a requirement for iron and oxygen for activity similar to that of membrane FADSs, and are involved in the initial oxidation of inactivated alkanes. Beta-carotene ketolase and beta-carotene hydroxylase are carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes for astaxanthin and zeaxanthin, respectively. This superfamily domain has extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of these sequences also reveals three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXX(X)H, HXX(X)HH, and HXXHH (an additional conserved histidine residue is seen between clusters 2 and 3). Spectroscopic and genetic evidence point to a nitrogen-rich coordination environment located in the cytoplasm with as many as eight histidines coordinating the two iron ions and a carboxylate residue bridging the two metals in the Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane hydroxylase (AlkB). In addition, the eight histidine residues are reported to be catalytically essential and proposed to be the ligands for the iron atoms contained within the rat stearoyl CoA delta-9 desaturase.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03507 The Delta12 Fatty Acid Desaturase (Delta12-FADS)-like CD includes the integral-membrane enzymes, delta-12 acyl-lipid desaturases, oleate 12-hydroxylases, omega3 and omega6 fatty acid desaturases, and other related proteins, found in a wide range of organisms including higher plants, green algae, diatoms, nematodes, fungi, and bacteria. The expression of these proteins appears to be temperature dependent: decreases in temperature result in increased levels of fatty acid desaturation within membrane lipids subsequently altering cell membrane fluidity. An important enzyme for the production of polyunsaturates in plants is the oleate delta-12 desaturase (Arabidopsis FAD2) of the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme accepts l-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as substrate and requires NADH:cytochrome b oxidoreductase, cytochrome b, and oxygen for activity. FAD2 converts oleate(18:1) to linoleate (18:2) and is closely related to oleate 12-hydroxylase which catalyzes the hydroxylation of oleate to ricinoleate. Plastid-bound desaturases (Arabidopsis delta-12 desaturase (FAD6), omega-3 desaturase (FAD8), omega-6 desaturase (FAD6)), as well as, the cyanobacterial thylakoid-bound FADSs require oxygen, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin oxidoreductase for activity. As in higher plants, the cyanobacteria delta-12 (DesA) and omega-3 (DesB) FADSs desaturate oleate (18:1) to linoleate (18:2) and linoleate (18:2) to linolenate (18:3), respectively. Omega-3 (DesB/FAD8) and omega-6 (DesD/FAD6) desaturases catalyze reactions that introduce a double bond between carbons three and four, and carbons six and seven, respectively, from the methyl end of fatty acids. As with other members of this superfamily, this domain family has extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of sequences also reveals the existence of three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXXH, HXX(X)HH, and HXXHH. These histidine residues are reported to be catalytically essential and proposed to be the ligands for the iron atoms contained within the homologue, stearoyl CoA desaturase. Mutation of any one of four of these histidines in the Synechocystis delta-12 acyl-lipid desaturase resulted in complete inactivity.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03513 Beta-carotene ketolase/oxygenase (CrtW, also known as CrtO), the carotenoid astaxanthin biosynthetic enzyme, initially catalyzes the addition of two keto groups to carbons C4 and C4' of beta-carotene. Carotenoids are important natural pigments produced by many microorganisms and plants. Astaxanthin is reported to be an antioxidant, an anti-cancer agent, and an immune system stimulant. A number of bacteria and green algae can convert beta-carotene into astaxanthin by using several ketocarotenoids as intermediates and CrtW and a beta-carotene hydroxylase (CrtZ). CrtW initially converts beta-carotene to canthaxanthin via echinenone, and CrtZ initially mediates the conversion of beta-carotene to zeaxanthin via beta-cryptoxanthin. After a few more intermediates are formed, CrtW and CrtZ act in combination to produce astaxanthin. Sequences of this domain family appear to be structurally related to membrane fatty acid desaturases and alkane hydroxylases. They all share in common extensive hydrophobic regions that are capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of these sequences also reveals three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXXH, HXXHH, and HXXHH.

            <td id=al>cd03514 Beta-carotene hydroxylase (CrtR), the carotenoid zeaxanthin biosynthetic enzyme catalyzes the addition of hydroxyl groups to the beta-ionone rings of beta-carotene to form zeaxanthin and is found in bacteria and red algae. Carotenoids are important natural pigments; zeaxanthin and lutein are the only dietary carotenoids that accumulate in the macular region of the retina and lens. It is proposed that these carotenoids protect ocular tissues against photooxidative damage. CrtR does not show overall amino acid sequence similarity to the beta-carotene hydroxylases similar to CrtZ, an astaxanthin biosynthetic beta-carotene hydroxylase. However, CrtR does show sequence similarity to the green alga, Haematococcus pluvialis, beta-carotene ketolase (CrtW), which converts beta-carotene to canthaxanthin. Sequences of the CrtR_beta-carotene-hydroxylase domain family, as well as, the CrtW_beta-carotene-ketolase domain family appear to be structurally related to membrane fatty acid desaturases and alkane hydroxylases. They all share in common extensive hydrophobic regions that would be capable of spanning the membrane bilayer at least twice. Comparison of these sequences also reveals three regions of conserved histidine cluster motifs that contain eight histidine residues: HXXXH, HXXHH, and HXXHH.
