            <td id=al>Putative substrate binding domain of sulfonate binding protein-like, a member of the type 2 periplasmic binding protein fold. This subfamily includes the periplasmic component of putative ABC-type sulfonate transport system similar to SsuA. These domains are found in eubacterial SsuA proteins that serve as initial receptors in the ABC transport of bicarbonate, nitrate, taurine, or a wide range of aliphatic sulfonates, while other closest homologs are involved in thiamine (vitamin B1) biosynthetic pathway and desulfurization (DszB). After binding the ligand, SsuA interacts with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. The SsuA proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge. They have been shown to bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>

Related proteins outside the scope of this model include taurine (NH2-CH2-CH2-S03H) binding proteins, the probable sulfate ester binding protein AtsR, and the probable aromatic sulfonate binding protein AsfC. All these families make sulfur available when Cys and sulfate levels are low. Please note that phylogenetic analysis by neighbor-joining suggests that a number of sequences belonging to this family have been excluded because of scoring lower than taurine-binding proteins.

ThiY is the periplasmic N-formyl-4-amino-5-(aminomethyl)-2-methylpyrimidine (FAMP) binding component of the ABC transport system (ThiXYZ). FAMP is imported into cell by the transporter, where it is then incorporated into the thiamin biosynthetic pathway. The closest structural homologs of ThiY are THI5, which is responsible for the synthesis of 4-amino-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P) in the thiamin biosynthetic pathway of eukaryotes, and periplasmic binding proteins involved in alkanesulfonate/nitrate and bicarbonate transport. After binding the ligand, They interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis. The ThiY/THI5 proteins belong to the PBP2 superfamily of periplasmic binding proteins that differ in size and ligand specificity, but have similar tertiary structures consisting of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge. They have been shown to bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.</td>
