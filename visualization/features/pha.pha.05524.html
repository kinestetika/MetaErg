            <td id=al>cd04242 AAK_G5K_ProB: Glutamate-5-kinase (G5K) catalyzes glutamate-dependent ATP cleavage; G5K transfers the terminal phosphoryl group of ATP to the gamma-carboxyl group of glutamate, in the first and controlling step of proline (and, in mammals, ornithine) biosynthesis. G5K is subject to feedback allosteric inhibition by proline or ornithine. In microorganisms and plants, proline plays an important role as an osmoprotectant and, in mammals, ornithine biosynthesis is crucial for proper ammonia detoxification, since a G5K mutation has been shown to cause human hyperammonaemia. Microbial G5K generally consists of two domains: a catalytic G5K domain and one PUA (pseudo uridine synthases and archaeosine-specific transglycosylases) domain, and some lack the PUA domain. G5K requires free Mg for activity, it is tetrameric, and it aggregates to higher forms in a proline-dependent way. G5K lacking the PUA domain remains tetrameric, active, and proline-inhibitable, but the Mg requirement and the proline-triggered aggregation are greatly diminished and abolished, respectively, and more proline is needed for inhibition. Although plant and animal G5Ks are part of a bifunctional polypeptide, delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), composed of an N-terminal G5K (ProB) and a C-terminal glutamyl 5- phosphate reductase (G5PR; ProA); bacterial and yeast G5Ks are monofunctional single-polypeptide enzymes. In this CD, all three domain architectures are present: G5K, G5K+PUA, and G5K+G5PR.</td>

            <td id=al>cd21157 PUA domain of gamma-glutamyl kinase, found in archaea, bacteria, and eukarya. Gamma glutamyl kinase (G5K) is an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of L-proline; it catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group to glutamate. The resulting glutamate 5-phosphate cyclizes spontaneously to form 5-oxoproline. The PUA (PseudoUridine synthase and Archaeosine transglycosylase) domain functions as an RNA binding domain in many other proteins; however, its role in G5K is not understood. It might play a role in modulating the enzymatic properties of bacterial G5Ks.</td>

Additionally, the PUA domain was detected in a family of eukaryotic proteins that also contain a domain homologous to the translation initiation factor eIF1/SUI1; these proteins may comprise a novel type of translation factors. Unexpectedly, the PUA domain was detected also in bacterial and yeast glutamate kinases; this is compatible with the demonstrated role of these enzymes in the regulation of the expression of other genes. It is predicted that the PUA domain is an RNA binding domain.</td>

In B. subtilis 168, the regulation of the diaminopimelate (Dap)-lysine biosynthetic pathway involves dual control by Dap and lysine, effected through separate Dap- and lysine-sensitive aspartokinase isoenzymes. The B. subtilis 168 AKII is induced by methionine, and repressed and inhibited by lysine. Although Corynebacterium glutamicum is known to contain a single aspartokinase isoenzyme type, both the succinylase and dehydrogenase variant pathways of DAP-lysine synthesis operate simultaneously in this organism. In this organism and other various Gram-positive bacteria, the DAP-lysine pathway is feedback regulated by the concerted action of lysine and theronine. Also included in this CD are the aspartokinases of the extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB27, the Gram-negative obligate methylotroph, Methylophilus methylotrophus AS1, and those single aspartokinases found in Pseudomons, C. glutamicum, and Amycolatopsis lactamdurans. B. subtilis 168 AKII, and the C. glutamicum, Streptomyces clavuligerus and A. lactamdurans aspartokinases are described as tetramers consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits; the alpha (44 kD) and beta (18 kD) subunits formed by two in-phase overlapping polypeptides.</td>
