            <td id=al>Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, N-terminal domain; a large, diverse group of cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of  glutathione (GSH) with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. In addition, GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This family, also referred to as soluble GSTs, is the largest family of GSH transferases and is only distantly related to the mitochondrial GSTs (GSTK subfamily, a member of the DsbA family). Soluble GSTs bear no structural similarity to microsomal GSTs (MAPEG family) and display additional activities unique to their group, such as catalyzing thiolysis, reduction  and isomerization of certain compounds. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. Based on sequence similarity, different classes of GSTs have been identified, which display varying tissue distribution, substrate specificities and additional specific activities. In humans, GSTs display polymorphisms which may influence individual susceptibility to diseases such as cancer, arthritis, allergy and sclerosis. Some GST family members with non-GST functions include glutaredoxin 2, the CLIC subfamily of anion channels, prion protein Ure2p, crystallins, metaxin 2 and stringent starvation protein A.</td>

            <td id=al>C-terminal, alpha helical domain of Class Lambda Glutathione S-transferases. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) C-terminal domain family, Class Lambda subfamily; composed of plant-specific class Lambda GSTs. GSTs are cytosolic, usually dimeric, proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins, and products of oxidative stress. The GST fold contains an N-terminal thioredoxin-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. GSH binds to the N-terminal domain while the hydrophobic substrate occupies a pocket in the C-terminal domain. The class Lambda subfamily was recently discovered, together with dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs), as two outlying groups of the GST superfamily in Arabidopsis thaliana, which contain conserved active site cysteines. Characterization of recombinant A. thaliana proteins show that Lambda class GSTs are monomeric, similar to DHARs. They do not exhibit GSH conjugating or DHAR activities, but are active as thiol transferases, similar to glutaredoxins. Members of this subfamily were originally identified as encoded proteins of the In2-1 gene, which can be induced by treatment with herbicide safeners.</td>
