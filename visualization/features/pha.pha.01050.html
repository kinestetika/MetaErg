            <td id=al>cd09810 light-dependent protochlorophyllide reductase (LPOR)-like, classical (c)-like SDRs. Classical SDR-like subgroup containing LPOR and related proteins. Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) reductases act in chlorophyll biosynthesis. There are distinct enzymes that catalyze Pchlide reduction in light or dark conditions. Light-dependent reduction is via an NADP-dependent SDR, LPOR. Proteins in this subfamily share the glycine-rich NAD-binding motif of the classical SDRs, have a partial match to the canonical active site tetrad, but lack the typical active site Ser. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

Classical SDR subgroup containing retinol-DHs, LPORs, and related proteins. Retinol is processed by a medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase followed by retinol-DHs. Pchlide reductases act in chlorophyll biosynthesis. There are distinct enzymes that catalyze Pchlide reduction in light or dark conditions. Light-dependent reduction is via an NADP-dependent SDR, LPOR. Proteins in this subfamily share the glycine-rich NAD-binding motif of the classical SDRs, have a partial match to the canonical active site tetrad, but lack the typical active site Ser. This subgroup includes the human proteins: retinol dehydrogenase -12, -13 ,and -14, dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member (DHRS)-12 , -13 and -X (a DHRS on chromosome X), and WWOX (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase), as well as a Neurospora crassa SDR encoded by the blue light inducible bli-4 gene.

            <td id=al>cd05324 Porcine testicular carbonyl reductase (PTCR)-like, classical (c) SDRs. PTCR is a classical SDR which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ketones on steroids and prostaglandins. Unlike most SDRs, PTCR functions as a monomer. This subgroup also includes human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and CBR3. CBR1 is an NADPH-dependent SDR with broad substrate specificity and may be responsible for the in vivo reduction of quinones, prostaglandins, and other carbonyl-containing compounds. In addition it includes poppy NADPH-dependent salutaridine reductase which catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of salutaridine to 7(S)-salutaridinol in the biosynthesis of morphine, and Arabidopsis SDR1,a menthone reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of menthone to neomenthol, a compound with antimicrobial activity; SDR1  can also carry out neomenthol oxidation. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

Proteins in this subgroup share the glycine-rich NAD-binding motif of the classical SDRs, have a partial match to the canonical active site tetrad, but lack the typical active site Ser. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

This subgroup resembles the SDR family, but does not have a perfect match to the NAD-binding motif or the catalytic tetrad characteristic of the SDRs. It includes the SDRs, Q9HYA2 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and APE0912 from Aeropyrum pernix K1. BKR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ACP in the first reductive step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS). FAS consists of four elongation steps, which are repeated to extend the fatty acid chain through the addition of two-carbo units from malonyl acyl-carrier protein (ACP): condensation, reduction, dehydration, and a final reduction. Type II FAS, typical of plants and many bacteria, maintains these activities on discrete polypeptides, while type I FAS utilizes one or two multifunctional polypeptides. BKR resembles enoyl reductase, which catalyzes the second reduction step in FAS. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region.

Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well as Asn (or Ser).

            <td id=al>cd08939 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR) and related proteins, classical (c) SDR. These proteins include members identified as KDSR, ribitol type dehydrogenase, and others. The group shows strong conservation of the active site tetrad and glycine rich NAD-binding motif of the classical SDRs. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.</td>

            <td id=al>cd08951 daunorubicin C-13 ketoreductase (KR), classical (c)-like SDRs. Daunorubicin is a clinically important therapeutic compound used in some cancer treatments. Daunorubicin C-13 ketoreductase is member of the classical SDR family with a canonical glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif, but lacking a complete match to the active site tetrad characteristic of this group. The critical Tyr, plus the Lys and upstream Asn are present, but the catalytic Ser is replaced, generally by Gln.
