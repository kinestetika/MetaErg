            <td id=al>cd02079 P-type heavy metal-transporting ATPase. Heavy metal-transporting ATPases (Type IB ATPases) transport heavy metal ions (Cu(+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), etc.) across biological membranes. These ATPases include mammalian copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B, Bacillus subtilis CadA which transports cadmium, zinc and cobalt out of the cell, Bacillus subtilis ZosA/PfeT which transports copper, and perhaps also zinc and ferrous iron, Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA and CopB, Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 CadA, a cadmium-efflux ATPase, and Escherichia coli ZntA which is selective for Pb(2+), Zn(2+), and Cd(2+). The characteristic N-terminal heavy metal associated (HMA) domain of this group is essential for the binding of metal ions.

            <td id=al>cd02094 P-type heavy metal-transporting ATPase, similar to human copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B. The mammalian copper-transporting P-type ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B are key molecules required for the regulation and maintenance of copper homeostasis. Menkes and Wilson diseases are caused by mutation in ATP7A and ATP7B respectively. This subfamily includes other copper-transporting ATPases such as: Bacillus subtilis CopA , Archeaoglobus fulgidus CopA, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ccc2p. This subclass of P-type ATPase is also referred to as CPx-type ATPases because their amino acid sequences contain a characteristic CPC or CPH motif associated with a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids and N-terminal ion-binding sequences.

            <td id=al>TIGR01512 heavy metal-(Cd/Co/Hg/Pb/Zn)-translocating P-type ATPase. This model describes the P-type ATPase primarily responsible for translocating cadmium ions (and other closely-related divalent heavy metals such as cobalt, mercury, lead and zinc) across biological membranes. These transporters are found in prokaryotes and plants. Experimentally characterized members of the seed alignment include: SP|P37617 from E. coli, SP|Q10866 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SP|Q59998 from Synechocystis PCC6803. The cadmium P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IB based on a phylogenetic analysis which combines the copper-translocating ATPases with the cadmium-translocating species. This model and that describing the copper-ATPases (TIGR01511) are well separated, and thus we further type the copper-ATPases as IB1 and the cadmium-ATPases as IB2. Several sequences which have not been characterized experimentally fall just below trusted cutoff for both of these models (SP|Q9CCL1 from Mycobacterium leprae, GP|13816263 from Sulfolobus solfataricus, OMNI|NTL01CJ01098 from Campylobacter jejuni, OMNI|NTL01HS01687 from Halobacterium sp., GP|6899169 from Ureaplasma urealyticum and OMNI|HP1503 from Helicobacter pylori).

            <td id=al>TIGR01511 copper-(or silver)-translocating P-type ATPase. This model describes the P-type ATPase primarily responsible for translocating copper ions accross biological membranes. These transporters are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This model encompasses those species which pump copper ions out of cells or organelles (efflux pumps such as CopA of Escherichia coli) as well as those which pump the ion into cells or organelles either for the purpose of supporting life in extremely low-copper environments (for example CopA of Enterococcus hirae) or for the specific delivery of copper to a biological complex for which it is a necessary component (for example FixI of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, or CtaA and PacS of Synechocystis). The substrate specificity of these transporters may, to a varying degree, include silver ions (for example, CopA from Archaeoglobus fulgidus). Copper transporters from this family are well known as the genes which are mutated in two human disorders of copper metabolism, Wilson's and Menkes' diseases. The sequences contributing to the seed of this model are all experimentally characterized. The copper P-type ATPases have been characterized as Type IB based on a phylogenetic analysis which combines the copper-translocating ATPases with the cadmium-translocating species. This model and that describing the cadmium-ATPases (TIGR01512) are well separated, and thus we further type the copper-ATPases as IB1 (and the cadmium-ATPases as IB2).

Accession PIR|A29576 from Enterococcus faecalis scores very high against this model, but yet is annotated as an "H+/K+ exchanging ATPase". BLAST of this sequence does not hit anything else annotated in this way. This error may come from the characterization paper published in 1987. Accession GP|7415611 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to be mis-annotated as a cadmium resistance protein. Accession OMNI|NTL01HS00542 from Halobacterium which scores above trusted for this model is annotated as "molybdenum-binding protein" although no evidence can be found for this classification.

Bacillus subtilis ZosA/PfeT (previously known as YkvW) transports copper, it may also transport zinc under oxidative stress and may also be involved in ferrous iron efflux. ZosA/PfeT is expressed under the regulation of the peroxide-sensing repressor PerR. It is involved in competence development. Disruption of the zosA/pfeT gene results in low transformability.

Bacillus subtilis CadA/YvgW appears to transport cadmium, zinc and cobalt but not copper, out of the cell. Functions in metal ion resistance and cellular metal ion homeostasis. CadA/YvgW is also important for sporulation in B. subtilis, the significant specific expression of the cadA/yvgW gene during the late stage of sporulation, is controlled by forespore-specific sigma factor, sigma G, and mother cell-specific sigma factor, sigma E. This subfamily also includes Helicobacter pylori CadA an essential resistance pump with ion specificity towards Cd(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+), and Zn-transporting ATPase, ZiaA(N) in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Transcription of ziaA is induced by Zn under the control of the Zn responsive repressor ZiaR.

            <td id=al>TIGR01494 ATPase, P-type (transporting), HAD superfamily, subfamily IC. The P-type ATPases are a large family of trans-membrane transporters acting on charged substances. The distinguishing feature of the family is the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate (aspartyl-phosphate) during the course of the reaction. Another common name for these enzymes is the E1-E2 ATPases based on the two isolable conformations: E1 (unphosphorylated) and E2 (phosphorylated). Generally, P-type ATPases consist of only a single subunit encompassing the ATPase and ion translocation pathway, however, in the case of the potassium (TIGR01497) and sodium/potassium (TIGR01106) varieties, these functions are split between two subunits. Additional small regulatory or stabilizing subunits may also exist in some forms. P-type ATPases are nearly ubiquitous in life and are found in numerous copies in higher organisms (at least 45 in Arabidopsis thaliana, for instance). Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the P-type ATPase subfamily is divided up into groups based on substrate specificities and this is represented in the various subfamily and equivalog models that have been made: IA (K+) TIGR01497, IB (heavy metals) TIGR01525, IIA1 (SERCA-type Ca++) TIGR01116, IIA2 (PMR1-type Ca++) TIGR01522, IIB (PMCA-type Ca++) TIGR01517, IIC (Na+/K+, H+/K+ antiporters) TIGR01106, IID (fungal-type Na+ and K+) TIGR01523, IIIA (H+) TIGR01647, IIIB (Mg++) TIGR01524, IV (phospholipid, flippase) TIGR01652 and V (unknown specificity) TIGR01657. The crystal structure of one calcium-pumping ATPase and an analysis of the fold of the catalytic domain of the P-type ATPases have been published. These reveal that the catalytic core of these enzymes is a haloacid dehalogenase(HAD)-type aspartate-nucleophile hydrolase. The location of the ATP-binding loop in between the first and second HAD conserved catalytic motifs defines these enzymes as members of subfamily I of the HAD superfamily (see also TIGR01493, TIGR01509, TIGR01549, TIGR01544 and TIGR01545). Based on these classifications, the P-type ATPase _superfamily_ corresponds to the IC subfamily of the HAD superfamily.</td>

This subfamily contains P-type ATPase transporters of unknown function, similar to Streptococcus pneumoniae Exp7. The P-type ATPases, are a large family of integral membrane transporters that are of critical importance in all kingdoms of life. They generate and maintain (electro-) chemical gradients across cellular membranes, by translocating cations, heavy metals and lipids. They are distinguished from other main classes of transport ATPases (F- , V- , and ABC- type) by the formation of a phosphorylated (P-) intermediate state in the catalytic cycle.  A general characteristic of P-type ATPases is a bundle of transmembrane helices which make up the transport path, and three domains on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Members include pumps that transport various light metal ions, such as H(+), Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+), pumps that transport indispensable trace elements, such as Zn(2+) and Cu(2+), pumps that remove toxic heavy metal ions, such as Cd(2+), and pumps such as aminophospholipid translocases which transport phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine.</td>
