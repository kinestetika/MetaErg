            <td id=al>TIGR02866 cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II. Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal electron acceptor of mitochondria (and one of several possible acceptors in prokaryotes) in the electron transport chain of aerobic respiration. The enzyme couples the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. This process results in the pumping of four protons across the membrane which are used in the proton gradient powered synthesis of ATP. The oxidase contains two heme a cofactors and three copper atoms as well as other bound ions. [Energy metabolism, Electron transport]</td>

            <td id=al>cd13919 Uncharacterized subfamily with similarity to Heme-copper oxidase subunit II cupredoxin domain. Heme-copper oxidases are transmembrane protein complexes in the respiratory chains of prokaryotes and mitochondria which catalyze the reduction of O2 and simultaneously pump protons across the membrane. The superfamily is diverse in terms of electron donors, subunit composition, and heme types. The number of subunits varies from two to five in bacteria and up to 13 in mammalian mitochondria. Subunits I, II, and III of mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) are encoded within the mitochondrial genome and the remaining 10 subunits are encoded within the nuclear genome. It has been proposed that archaea acquired heme-copper oxidases through gene transfer from gram-positive bacteria. Subunit II is found in CcO, ubiquinol oxidase, and the ba3-like oxidases, while the cbb3 oxidases contain alternative additional subunits.  Additionally, nitrous oxide reductase contains the globular portion of subunit II as a domain within its structure. In some families, subunit II contains a copper-copper binuclear center that is involved in the transfer of electrons from the substrate to the binuclear center (active site) in subunit I.</td>

The ba3 family of heme-copper oxidases are transmembrane protein complexes in the respiratory chains of prokaryotes and some archaea, which catalyze the reduction of O2 and simultaneously pump protons across the membrane. It has been proposed that archaea acquired heme-copper oxidases through gene transfer from gram-positive bacteria. The ba3 family contains oxidases that lack the conserved residues that form the D- and K-pathways in CcO and ubiquinol oxidase. Instead, they contain a potential alternative K-pathway. Additional proton channels have been proposed for this family of oxidases but none have been identified definitively.</td>
