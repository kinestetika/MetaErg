            <td id=al>Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Methanosaeta harundinacea FilI and some hybrid sensor histidine kinases. This family includes FilI, the histidine kinase (HK) component of FilI-FilRs, a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanosaeta harundinacea, which is involved in regulating methanogenesis. The cytoplasmic HK core consists of a C-terminal HK-like ATPase domain (represented here) and a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA) domain, which, in FilI, are coupled to CHASE, HAMP, PAS, and GAF sensor domains. FilI-FilRs catalyzes the phosphotransfer between FilI (HK) and FilRs (FilR1 and FilR2, response regulators) of the TCS. TCSs are predicted to be of bacterial origin, and acquired by archaea by horizontal gene transfer. This model also includes related HATPase domains such as that of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 phytochrome-like protein Cph1. Proteins having this HATPase domain and HisKA domain also have accessory sensor domains such as CHASE, GAF, HAMP and PAS; some are  hybrid sensor histidine kinases as they also contain a REC signal receiver domain.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of response regulators (RRs) and pseudo response regulators (PRRs). Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators similar to Arabidopsis thaliana CKI1 and Escherichia coli RcsC. This family is composed of hybrid sensor histidine kinases/response regulators that are sensor histidine kinases (HKs) fused with a REC domain, similar to the sensor histidine kinase CKI1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is involved in multi-step phosphorelay (MSP) signaling that mediates responses to a variety of important stimuli in plants. MSP involves a signal being transferred from HKs via histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) to nuclear response regulators. The CKI1 REC domain specifically interacts with the downstream signaling protein AHP2, AHP3 and AHP5. The plant MSP system has evolved from the prokaryotic two-component system (TCS), which allows organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. This family also includes bacterial hybrid sensor HKs such as Escherichia coli RcsC, which is a component of the Rcs signalling pathway that controls a variety of physiological functions like capsule synthesis, cell division, and motility. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase response regulator RpfG and similar proteins. Cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase response regulator RpfG, together with sensory/regulatory protein RpfC, constitute a two-component system implicated in sensing and responding to the diffusible signal factor (DSF) that is essential for cell-cell signaling. RpfC is a hybrid sensor/histidine kinase that phosphorylates and activates RpfG, which degrades cyclic di-GMP to GMP, leading to the activation of Clp, a global transcriptional regulator that regulates a large set of genes in the DSF pathway. RpfG contains a CheY-like receiver domain attached to a histidine-aspartic acid-glycine-tyrosine-proline (HD-GYP) cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa RssB and similar domains. Pseudomonas aeruginosa RssB is an orphan atypical response regulator containing a REC domain and a PP2C-type protein phosphatase output domain. Its function is still unknown. Escherichia RssB, which is not included in this subfamily, is a ClpX adaptor protein which alters ClpX specificity by mediating a specific interaction between ClpX and the substrates such as RpoS, an RNA polymerase sigma factor. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

CtrA is part of the CckA-ChpT-CtrA phosphorelay that is conserved in alphaproteobacteria and is important in orchestrating the cell cycle, polar development, and flagellar biogenesis. CtrA is the master regulator of flagella synthesis genes and also regulates genes involved in the cell cycle, exopolysaccharide synthesis, and cyclic-di-GMP signaling. CtrA is active as a transcription factor when phosphorylated. It is a member of the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators, characterized by a REC domain and a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding output effector domain.

The CheV pathway is one of three systems employed by B. subtilis for sensory adaptation that contribute to chemotaxis. It is involved in the transmission of sensory signals from chemoreceptors to flagellar motors. Together with CheW, it is involved in the coupling of methyl-accepting chemoreceptors to the central two-component histidine kinase CheA. FrzE is a hybrid sensor histidine kinase/response regulator that is part of the Frz pathway that controls cell reversal frequency to support directional motility during swarming and fruiting body formation. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

This subfamily of NtrC proteins include Aquifex aeolicus NtrC1 and Vibrio quorum-sensing signal integrator LuxO. The N-terminal REC domain of NtrC proteins regulate the activity of the protein and its phosphorylation controls the AAA+ domain oligomerization, while the central AAA+ domain participates in nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, oligomerization, and sigma54 interaction.

            <td id=al>phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of chemotaxis response regulator protein-glutamate methylesterase CheB and similar chemotaxis proteins. Methylesterase CheB is a chemotaxis response regulator with an N-terminal REC domain and a C-terminal methylesterase domain. Chemotaxis is a behavior known in motile bacteria that directs their movement in response to chemical gradients. CheB is a phosphorylation-activated response regulator involved in the reversible modification of bacterial chemotaxis receptors. It catalyzes the demethylation of specific methylglutamate residues introduced into the chemoreceptors (methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) by CheR. The CheB REC domain packs against the active site of the C-terminal domain and inhibits methylesterase activity by directly restricting access to the active site. Also included in this family is chemotaxis response regulator CheY, which contains a stand-alone REC domain, and an uncharacterized subfamily composed of proteins containing an N-terminal REC domain and a C-terminal CheY-P phosphatase (CheC) domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
