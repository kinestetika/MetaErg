            <td id=al>catalytic core domain of leucyl-tRNA synthetases. Leucyl tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) catalytic core domain. This class I enzyme is a monomer which aminoacylates the 2'-OH of the nucleotide at the 3' of the appropriate tRNA. The core domain is based on the Rossman fold and is responsible for the ATP-dependent formation of the enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate. It contains the characteristic class I HIGH and KMSKS motifs, which are involved in ATP binding. In Aquifex aeolicus, the gene encoding LeuRS is split in two, just before the KMSKS motif. Consequently, LeuRS is a heterodimer, which likely superimposes with the LeuRS monomer found in most other organisms. LeuRS has an insertion in the core domain, which is subject to both deletions and rearrangements and thus differs between prokaryotic LeuRS and archaeal/eukaryotic LeuRS. This editing region hydrolyzes mischarged cognate tRNAs and thus prevents the incorporation of chemically similar amino acids.</td>

            <td id=al>catalytic core domain of methioninyl-tRNA synthetases. Methionine tRNA synthetase (MetRS) catalytic core domain. This class I enzyme aminoacylates the 2'-OH of the nucleotide at the 3' of the appropriate tRNA. MetRS, which consists of the core domain and an anti-codon binding domain, functions as a monomer. However, in some species the anti-codon binding domain is followed by an EMAP domain. In this case, MetRS functions as a homodimer. The core domain is based on the Rossman fold and is responsible for the ATP-dependent formation of the enzyme bound aminoacyl-adenylate. It contains the characteristic class I HIGH and KMSKS motifs, which are involved in ATP binding.  As a result of a deletion event, MetRS has a significantly shorter core domain insertion than IleRS, ValRS, and LeuR.  Consequently, the MetRS insertion lacks the editing function.</td>

            <td id=al>CAAD domains of cyanobacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. This domain is present in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), enzymes that couple tRNAs to their cognate amino acids. aaRSs from cyanobacteria containing the CAAD (for cyanobacterial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases appended domain) protein domains are localized in the thylakoid membrane. The domain bears two putative transmembrane helices and is present in glutamyl-, isoleucyl-, leucyl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases, the latter of which has probably recruited the domain more than once during evolution.</td>

            <td id=al>methionine--tRNA ligase. The methionyl-tRNA synthetase (metG) is a class I amino acyl-tRNA ligase. This model appears to recognize the methionyl-tRNA synthetase of every species, including eukaryotic cytosolic and mitochondrial forms. The UPGMA difference tree calculated after search and alignment according to this model shows an unusual deep split between two families of MetG. One family contains forms from the Archaea, yeast cytosol, spirochetes, and E. coli, among others. The other family includes forms from yeast mitochondrion, Synechocystis sp., Bacillus subtilis, the Mycoplasmas, Aquifex aeolicus, and Helicobacter pylori. The E. coli enzyme is homodimeric, although monomeric forms can be prepared that are fully active. Activity of this enzyme in bacteria includes aminoacylation of fMet-tRNA with Met; subsequent formylation of the Met to fMet is catalyzed by a separate enzyme. Note that the protein from Aquifex aeolicus is split into an alpha (large) and beta (small) subunit; this model does not include the C-terminal region corresponding to the beta chain.

Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases catalyze the transfer of cognate amino acids to the 3'-end of their tRNAs by specifically recognizing cognate from non-cognate amino acids. Members include valyl-, leucyl-, isoleucyl-, cysteinyl-, arginyl-, and methionyl-tRNA synthethases. This superfamily also includes a domain from MshC, an enzyme in the mycothiol biosynthetic pathway.</td>
