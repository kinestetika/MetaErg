            <td id=al>Dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) catalyzes the conversion of DAHP to DHQ in shikimate pathway for aromatic compounds synthesis. Dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) catalyzes the conversion of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) to dehydroquinate (DHQ) in the second step of the shikimate pathway. This pathway, which involves seven sequential enzymatic steps in the conversion of erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate into chorismate for subsequent synthesis of aromatic compounds, is found in bacteria, microbial eukaryotes, and plants, but not in mammals. Therefore, enzymes of this pathway are attractive targets for the development of non-toxic antimicrobial compounds, herbicides and anti-parasitic agents. The activity of DHQS requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as cofactor. A single active site in DHQS catalyzes five sequential reactions involving alcohol oxidation, phosphate elimination, carbonyl reduction, ring opening, and intramolecular aldol condensation. The binding of substrates and ligands induces domain conformational changes. In some fungi and protozoa, this domain is fused with the other four domains in shikimate pathway and forms a penta-domain AROM protein, which catalyzes steps 2-6 in the shikimate pathway.</td>

This reaction is part of the shikimate pathway which is involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids.</td>

They are important antibacterial agents. DOIS is a homolog of the dehydroquinate synthase which catalyzes the cyclization of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heputulosonate-7-phosphate to dehydroquinate (DHQ) in the shikimate pathway.</td>

The cyclization product, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone ((2S,3S,4S,5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanon-2,3,4,5-tetrol), is a precursor of the valienamine moiety.

            <td id=al>Dehydroquinate synthase-like (DHQ-like) and iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases (Fe-ADH). This superfamily consists of two subgroups: the dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS)-like, and a large metal-containing alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), known as iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases. Dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) catalyzes the conversion of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) to dehydroquinate (DHQ) in the second step of the shikimate pathway. This pathway involves seven sequential enzymatic steps in the conversion of erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate into chorismate for subsequent synthesis of aromatic compounds. Dehydroquinate synthase-like group includes dehydroquinate synthase, 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase, and 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase. The alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in this superfamily contain a dehydroquinate synthase-like protein structural fold and mostly contain iron. They are distinct from other alcohol dehydrogenases which contains different protein domains. There are several distinct families of alcohol dehydrogenases: Zinc-containing long-chain alcohol dehydrogenases; insect-type, or short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases; iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases, and others. The iron-containing family has a Rossmann fold-like topology that resembles the fold of the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, but lacks sequence homology, and differs in strand arrangement. ADH catalyzes the reversible oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde with the simultaneous reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H.</td>

            <td id=al>Sn-glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gro1PDH) catalyzes the reversible conversion between dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol-1-phosphate using either NADH or NADPH as a coenzyme. Sn-glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gro1PDH, EC 1.1.1.261) plays an important role in the formation of the enantiomeric configuration of the glycerophosphate backbone (sn-glycerol-1-phosphate) of archaeal ether lipids. It catalyzes the reversible conversion between dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycerol-1-phosphate using either NADH or NADPH as a coenzyme. The activity is zinc-dependent. One characteristic feature of archaea is that their cellular membrane has an ether linkage between the glycerol backbone and the hydrocarbon residues. The polar lipids of the members of Archaea consist of di- and tetra-ethers of glycerol with isoprenoid alcohols bound at the sn-2 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol moiety. The archaeal polar lipids have the enantiomeric configuration of a glycerophosphate backbone [sn-glycerol-1-phosphate (G-1-P)] that is the mirror image structure of the bacterial or eukaryal counterpart [sn-glycerol- 3-phosphate (G-3-P)]. The absolute stereochemistry of the glycerol moiety in all archaeal polar lipids is opposite to that of glycerol ester lipids in bacteria and eukarya.</td>
