            <td id=al>cd02511 UDP-glucose LOS-beta-1,4 glucosyltransferase is required for biosynthesis of lipooligosaccharide. UDP-glucose: lipooligosaccharide (LOS)  beta-1-4-glucosyltransferase catalyzes the addition of the first residue, glucose, of the lacto-N-neotetrase structure to HepI of the LOS inner core.  LOS is the major constituent of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of gram-positive bacteria. It consists of a short oligosaccharide chain of variable composition (alpha chain) attached to a branched inner core which is lined in turn to lipid A. Beta 1,4 glucosyltransferase is required to attach the alpha chain to the inner core.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00761 Glycosyltransferase family A (GT-A) includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are enzymes that synthesize oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates by transferring the sugar moiety from an activated nucleotide-sugar donor to an acceptor molecule, which may be a growing oligosaccharide, a lipid, or a protein.  Based on the stereochemistry of the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins. But it also includes families GT-43, GT-6, GT-8, GT13 and GT-7; which are evolutionarily related to GT-2 and share structure similarities.</td>

            <td id=al>cd02522 GT_2_like_a represents a glycosyltransferase family-2 subfamily with unknown function. Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) subfamily of unknown function. GT-2 includes diverse families of glycosyltransferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. These are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. Glycosyltransferases have been classified into more than 90 distinct sequence based families.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06423 CESA_like is  the cellulose synthase superfamily. The cellulose synthase (CESA) superfamily includes a wide variety of glycosyltransferase family 2 enzymes that share the common characteristic of catalyzing the elongation of polysaccharide chains. The members include cellulose synthase catalytic subunit, chitin synthase, glucan biosynthesis protein and other families of CESA-like proteins. Cellulose synthase catalyzes the polymerization reaction of cellulose, an aggregate of unbranched polymers of beta-1,4-linked glucose residues in  plants, most algae, some bacteria and fungi, and even some animals. In bacteria, algae and lower eukaryotes, there is a second unrelated type of cellulose synthase (Type II), which produces acylated cellulose, a derivative of cellulose. Chitin synthase catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from substrate UDP-GlcNAc into chitin, which is a linear homopolymer of beta-(1,4)-linked GlcNAc residues and Glucan Biosynthesis protein catalyzes the elongation of beta-1,2 polyglucose chains of Glucan.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06438 EpsO protein participates in the methanolan synthesis. The Methylobacillus sp EpsO protein is predicted to participate in the methanolan synthesis. Methanolan is an exopolysaccharide (EPS), composed of glucose, mannose and galactose.  A 21 genes cluster was predicted to participate in the methanolan synthesis. Gene disruption analysis revealed that EpsO is one of the glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in the synthesis of repeating sugar units onto the lipid carrier.</td>
