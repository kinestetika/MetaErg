This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli or Vibrio cholera PhoR, the histidine kinase (HK) of PhoB-PhoR a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) involved in phosphate regulation. PhoR monitors extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability and PhoB, the response regulator, regulates transcription of genes of the phosphate regulon. PhoR is a bifunctional histidine autokinase/phospho-PhoB phosphatase; in phosphate deficiency, it autophosphorylates and Pi is transferred to PhoB, and when environmental Pi is abundant, it removes the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated PhoB. Other roles of PhoB-PhoR TCS have been described, including motility, biofilm formation, intestinal colonization, and virulence in V. cholera. E.coli PhoR and Bacillus subtilis PhoR (whose HATPase domain belongs to a different family) sense very different signals in each bacterium. In E. coli the PhoR signal comes from phosphate transport mediated by the PstSCAB2 phosphate transporter and the PhoU chaperone-like protein while in B. subtilis, the PhoR activation signal comes from wall teichoic acid (WTA) metabolism.</td>

This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase domains of Escherichia coli K-12 DpiB and DcuS, and Bacillus subtilis CitS, DctS and MalK histidine kinases (HKs) all of which are two component transduction systems (TCSs). E. coli K-12 DpiB (also known as CitA) is the histidine kinase (HK) of DpiA-DpiB, a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) required for the expression of citrate-specific fermentation genes and genes involved in plasmid inheritance. E. coli K-12 DcuS (also known as YjdH) is the HK of DcuS-DcuR, a TCS that in the presence of the extracellular C4-dicarboxlates, activates the expression of the genes of anaerobic fumarate respiration and of aerobic C4-dicarboxylate uptake. CitS is the HK of Bacillus subtilis CitS-CitT, a TCS which regulates expression of CitM, the Mg-citrate transporter. Bacillus subtilis DctS forms a tripartite sensor unit (DctS/DctA/DctB) for sensing C4 dicarboxylates.  Bacillus subtilis MalK (also known as YfuL) is the HK of MalK-MalR (YufL-YufM) a TCS which regulates the expression of the malate transporters MaeN (YufR) and YflS, and is essential for utilization of malate in minimal medium. Proteins having this DpiB-CitA-like HATPase domain generally have sensor domains such as Cache and PAS, and a histidine kinase A (HisKA)-like SpoOB-type, alpha-helical domain.</td>

Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17574 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of OmpR family response regulators. OmpR-like proteins are one of the most widespread transcriptional regulators. OmpR family members contain REC and winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding output effector domain.  They are involved in the control of environmental stress tolerance (such as the oxidative, osmotic and acid stress response), motility, virulence, outer membrane biogenesis and other processes. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17562 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of chemotaxis response regulator CheY4 and similar CheY family proteins. CheY family chemotaxis response regulators (RRs) comprise about 17%  of bacterial RRs and almost half of all RRs in archaea. This subfamily contains Vibrio cholerae CheY4 and similar CheY family RRs. CheY proteins control bacterial motility and participate in signaling phosphorelays and in protein-protein interactions. CheY RRs contain only the REC domain with no output/effector domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>cd16954 Histidine kinase-like ATPase domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoQ and Providencia stuartii AarG. This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoQ and Providencia stuartii AarG. PhoQ is the histidine kinase (HK) of the PhoP-PhoQ two-component regulatory system (TCS), which responds to the levels of Mg2+ and Ca2+, controls virulence, mediates the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments, and regulates numerous cellular activities. Providencia stuartii AarG is a putative sensor kinase which controls the expression of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase and an intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) response in Providencia stuartii. The AarG product is similar to PhoQ in that it is able to restore wild-type levels of resistance to a Salmonella typhimurium phoQ mutant. However, the expression of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase gene and of aarP (a gene encoding a transcriptional activator of 2'-N-acetyltransferase) are not significantly affected by the levels of Mg2+ or Ca2+. Most proteins in this group contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA); some have an accessory HAMP sensor domain, and some have an intracellular membrane -interaction PhoQ sensor domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd19937 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of BsPhoP-like OmpR family response regulators. Bacillus subtilis PhoP (BsPhoP) is part of the PhoPR two-component system that participates in a signal transduction network that controls adaptation of the bacteria to phosphate deficiency by regulating (activating or repressing) genes of the Pho regulon upon phosphorylation by PhoR. When activated, PhoPR directs expression of phosphate scavenging enzymes, lowers synthesis of the phosphate-rich wall teichoic acid (WTA) and initiates synthesis of teichuronic acid, a non-phosphate containing replacement anionic polymer. Members of this subfamily belong to the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators, which are characterized by a REC domain and a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding output effector domain. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17580 second phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of Dictyostelium discoideum hybrid signal transduction histidine kinase D and similar domains. Dictyostelium discoideum hybrid signal transduction histidine kinase D (DhkD) is a large protein that contains two histidine kinase (HK) and two REC domains on the intracellular side of a single pass transmembrane domain, and extracellular PAS and PAC domains that likely are involved in ligand binding. This model represents the second REC domain and similar domains. DhkD activates the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA to ensure proper prestalk and prespore patterning, tip formation, and the vertical elongation of the mound into a finger, in Dictyostelium discoideum. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17598 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of uncharacterized hybrid sensor histidine kinase/response regulators. Typically, two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) consist of a sensor (histidine kinase) that responds to specific input(s) by modifying the output of a cognate response regulator (RR). TCSs allow organisms to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. Hybrid sensor histidine kinase/response regulators contain all the elements of a classical TCS in a single polypeptide chain. RRs share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
