Nitrate/nitrite response regulator protein NarL contains an N-terminal REC domain and a C-terminal LuxR family helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding output domain. Escherichia coli NarL activates the expression of the nitrate reductase (narGHJI) and formate dehydrogenase-N (fdnGHI) operons, and represses the transcription of the fumarate reductase (frdABCD) operon in response to a nitrate/nitrite induction signal. Phosphorylation of the NarL REC domain releases the C-terminal HTH output domain that subsequently binds specific DNA promoter sites to repress or activate gene expression. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>cd06170 C-terminal DNA-binding domain of LuxR-like proteins. This domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif and binds DNA. Proteins belonging to this group are response regulators; some act as transcriptional activators, others as transcriptional repressors. Many are active as homodimers. Many are two domain proteins in which the DNA binding property of the C-terminal DNA binding domain is modulated by modifications of the N-terminal domain.  For example in the case of Lux R which participates in the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density (quorum-sensing), a signaling molecule, the pheromone Acyl HSL (N-acyl derivatives of homoserine lactone), binds to the N-terminal domain and leads to LuxR dimerization.  For others phophorylation of the N-terminal domain leads to multimerization, for example Escherichia coli NarL and Sinorhizobium melilot FixJ. NarL controls gene expression of many respiratory-related operons when environmental nitrate or nitrite is present under anerobic conditions. FixJ is involved in the transcriptional activation of nitrogen fixation genes. The group also includes small proteins which lack an N-terminal signaling domain, such as Bacillus subtilis GerE.  GerE is dimeric and acts in conjunction with sigmaK as an activator or a repressor modulating the expression of various genes in particular those encoding the spore-coat. These LuxR family regulators may share a similar organization of their target binding sites. For example the LuxR dimer binds the lux box, a 20bp inverted repeat, GerE dimers bind two 12bp consensus sequences in inverted orientation having the central four bases overlap, and the NarL dimer binds two 7bp inverted repeats separated by 2 bp.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17624 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of PmrA-like OmpR family response regulators. This subfamily contains various OmpR family response regulators including PmrA, BasR, QseB, tctD, and RssB, which are components of two-component regulatory systems (TCSs). The PmrA/PmrB TCS controls transcription of genes that are involved in lipopolysaccharide modification in the outer membrane of bacteria, increasing bacterial resistance to host-derived antimicrobial peptides. The BasS/BasR TCS functions as an iron- and zinc-sensing transcription regulator. The QseB/QseC TCS activates the flagella regulon by activating transcription of FlhDC. The RssA/RssB TCS regulates swarming behavior in Serratia marcescens. OmpR family DNA-binding response regulators contain N-terminal receiver (REC) and C-terminal DNA-binding winged helix-turn-helix effector domains. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

YesN is a member of the two-component regulatory system YesM/YesN and SAR0214 is a member of the probable two-component regulatory system SAR0215/SAR0214. Also included in this family is the AlgR-like group of LytTR/AlgR family response, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive alginate biosynthesis regulatory protein AlgR and Bacillus subtilis sensory transduction protein LytT, among others.

            <td id=al>cd00156 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of response regulators (RRs) and pseudo response regulators (PRRs). Two-component systems (TCSs) involving a sensor and a response regulator are used by bacteria to adapt to changing environments. Processes regulated by two-component systems in bacteria include sporulation, pathogenicity, virulence, chemotaxis, and membrane transport. Response regulators (RRs) share the common phosphoacceptor REC domain and different effector/output domains such as DNA, RNA, ligand-binding, protein-binding, or enzymatic domains. Response regulators regulate transcription, post-transcription or post-translation, or have functions such as methylesterases, adenylate or diguanylate cyclase, c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases, histidine kinases, serine/threonine protein kinases, and protein phosphatases, depending on their output domains. The function of some output domains are still unknown. TCSs are found in all three domains of life - bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, however, the presence and abundance of particular RRs vary between the lineages. Archaea encode very few RRs with DNA-binding output domains; most are stand-alone REC domains. Among eukaryotes, TCSs are found primarily in protozoa, fungi, algae, and green plants. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within RRs, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

DesR is a response regulator that, together with its cognate sensor kinase DesK, comprises a two-component regulatory system that controls membrane fluidity. Phosphorylation of the REC domain of DesR is allosterically coupled to two distinct exposed surfaces of the protein, controlling noncanonical dimerization/tetramerization, cooperative activation, and DesK binding. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

            <td id=al>cd17532 phosphoacceptor receiver (REC) domain of LytTR/AlgR family response regulators similar to AlgR. Members of the LytTR/AlgR family of response regulators contain a REC domain and a unique LytTR DNA-binding output domain that lacks the helix-turn-helix motif and consists mostly of beta-strands. Transcriptional regulators with the LytTR-type output domains are involved in biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, fimbriation, expression of exoproteins, including toxins, and quorum sensing. Included in this AlgR-like group of LytTR/AlgR family response regulators are Streptococcus agalactiae sensory transduction protein LytR, Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive alginate biosynthesis regulatory protein AlgR, Bacillus subtilis sensory transduction protein LytT, and Escherichia coli transcriptional regulatory protein BtsR, which are members of two-component regulatory systems. LytR and LytT are components of regulatory systems that regulate genes involved in cell wall metabolism. AlgR positively regulates the algD gene, which codes for a GDP-mannose dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the alginate biosynthesis pathway. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>

In addition, the KdpD/KdpE TCS is also an adaptive regulator involved in the virulence and intracellular survival of pathogenic bacteria. KdpE is a member of the OmpR family of DNA-binding response regulators that contain REC and winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding output effector domains.

Chemotaxis is a behavior known for motile bacteria that directs their movement in response to chemical gradients. CheY is involved in transmitting sensory signals from chemoreceptors to the flagellar motors. Phosphorylated CheY interacts with the flagella switch components FliM and FliY, which causes counterclockwise rotation of the flagella, resulting in smooth swimming. REC domains function as phosphorylation-mediated switches within response regulators, but some also transfer phosphoryl groups in multistep phosphorelays.</td>
