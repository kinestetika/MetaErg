            <td id=al>TIGR01990 beta-phosphoglucomutase. This model represents the beta-phosphoglucomutase enzyme which catalyzes the interconverison of beta-D-glucose-1-phosphate and beta-D-glucose-6-phosphate. The 6-phosphate is capable of non-enzymatic anomerization (alpha <-> beta) while the 1-phosphate is not. A separate enzyme is responsible for the isomerization of the alpha anomers. Beta-D-glucose-1-phosphate results from the phosphorylysis of maltose (2.4.1.8), trehalose (2.4.1.64) or trehalose-6-phosphate (2.4.1.216). Alternatively, these reactions can be run in the synthetic direction to create the disaccharides. All sequenced genomes which contain a member of this family also appear to contain at least one putative maltose or trehalose phosphorylase. Three species, Lactococcus, Enterococcus and Neisseria appear to contain a pair of paralogous beta-PGM's. Beta-phosphoglucomutase is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily of hydrolase enzymes. These enzymes are characterized by a series of three catalytic motifs positioned within an alpha-beta (Rossman) fold. beta-PGM contains an inserted alpha helical domain in between the first and second conserved motifs and thus is a member of subfamily IA of the superfamily. The third catalytic motif comes in three variants, the third of which, containing a conserved DD or ED, is the only one found here as well as in several other related enzymes (TIGR01509). The enzyme from L. lactis has been extensively characterized including a remarkable crystal structure which traps the pentacoordinate transition state.

All of these are members of the larger Haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) subfamily IA and include the "variant 3" glu-asp version of the third conserved HAD domain (TIGR01509).</td>

            <td id=al>cd02598 beta-phosphoglucomutase, similar to Lactococcus lactis beta-phosphoglucomutase (beta-PGM). Lactococcus lactis beta-PGM catalyzes the interconversion of beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) and D-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), forming beta-D-glucose 1,6-(bis)phosphate as an intermediate. In the forward G6P-forming direction, this reaction links polysaccharide phosphorolysis to glycolysis, in the reverse direction, the reaction provides G1P for the biosynthesis of exo-polysaccharides. This subfamily belongs to the beta-phosphoglucomutase-like family whose other members include Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphatases GPP1 and GPP2 that dephosphorylate DL-glycerol-3-phosphate and DOG1 and DOG2 that dephosphorylate 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate, and Escherichia coli 6-phosphogluconate phosphatase YieH. This family belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase-like (HAD) hydrolases, a large superfamily of diverse enzymes that catalyze carbon or phosphoryl group transfer reactions on a range of substrates, using an active site aspartate in nucleophilic catalysis. Members of this superfamily include 2-L-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase, azetidine hydrolase, phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphomannomutase, P-type ATPases and many others. HAD hydrolases are found in all three kingdoms of life, and most genomes are predicted to contain multiple HAD-like proteins. Members possess a highly conserved alpha/beta core domain, and many also possess a small cap domain, the fold and function of which is variable. HAD hydrolases are sometimes referred to as belonging to the DDDD superfamily of phosphohydrolases.</td>

            <td id=al>TIGR01509 haloacid dehalogenase superfamily, subfamily IA, variant 3 with third motif having DD or ED. This model represents part of one structural subfamily of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs. The subfamilies are defined based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called "capping domain", or the absence of such a domain. Subfamily I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs. Subfamily II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs. Subfamily III sequences have no capping domain in either of these positions. The Subfamily IA and IB capping domains are predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of an alpha helical bundle. Subfamily I encompasses such a wide region of sequence space (the sequences are highly divergent) that representing it with a single model is impossible, resulting in an overly broad description which allows in many unrelated sequences. Subfamily IA and IB are separated based on an aparrent phylogenetic bifurcation. Subfamily IA is still too broad to model, but cannot be further subdivided into large chunks based on phylogenetic trees. Of the three motifs defining the HAD superfamily, the third has three variant forms: (1) hhhhsDxxx(x)D, (2) hhhhssxxx(x)D and (3) hhhhDDxxx(x)s where _s_ refers to a small amino acid and _h_ to a hydrophobic one. All three of these variants are found in subfamily IA. Individual models were made based on seeds exhibiting only one of the variants each. Variant 3 (this model) is found in the enzymes beta-phosphoglucomutase (TIGR01990) and deoxyglucose-6-phosphatase, while many other enzymes of subfamily IA exhibit this variant as well as variant 1 (TIGR01549). These three variant models were created with the knowledge that there will be overlap among them - this is by design and serves the purpose of eliminating the overlap with models of more distantly related HAD subfamilies caused by an overly broad single model.

This subfamily includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae DL-glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase (GPP1p/ Rhr2p and GPP2p/HOR2p) and 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate phosphatase (DOG1p and DOG2p). GPP1p and GPP2p are involved in glycerol biosynthesis, GPP1 is induced in response to both anaerobic and hyperosmotic stress, GPP2 is induced in response to hyperosmotic or oxidative stress, and during diauxic shift; overexpression of DOG1 or DOG2 confers 2-deoxyglucose resistance. These belong to the beta-phosphoglucomutase-like family whose other members include Lactococcus lactis beta-PGM, a mutase which catalyzes the interconversion of beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) and D-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), and Escherichia coli 6-phosphogluconate phosphatase YieH.

This family includes L-2-haloacid dehalogenase, epoxide hydrolases and phosphatases. The structure of the family consists of two domains. One is an inserted four helix bundle, which is the least well conserved region of the alignment, between residues 16 and 96 of Pseudomonas sp. (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase 1. The rest of the fold is composed of the core alpha/beta domain. Those members with the characteristic DxD triad at the N-terminus are probably phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) phosphatases involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis in the mitochondria.</td>

AtGpp1 and AtGpp2 are constitutively expressed in all the Arabidopsis tissues and unaffected under abiotic stress. Overexpression of AtGpp2 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants increases the specific DL-glycerol-3-phosphatase activity and improves the plants tolerance to salt, osmotic and oxidative stress. It belongs to the beta-phosphoglucomutase-like family whose other members include Lactococcus lactis beta-PGM, a mutase which catalyzes the interconversion of beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) and D-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphatases GPP1 and GPP2 that dephosphorylate DL-glycerol-3-phosphate and DOG1 and DOG2 that dephosphorylate 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate, and Escherichia coli 6-phosphogluconate phosphatase YieH. This family belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase-like (HAD) hydrolases, a large superfamily of diverse enzymes that catalyze carbon or phosphoryl group transfer reactions on a range of substrates, using an active site aspartate in nucleophilic catalysis. Members of this superfamily include 2-L-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase, azetidine hydrolase, phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphomannomutase, P-type ATPases and many others. HAD hydrolases are found in all three kingdoms of life, and most genomes are predicted to contain multiple HAD-like proteins. Members possess a highly conserved alpha/beta core domain, and many also possess a small cap domain, the fold and function of which is variable. HAD hydrolases are sometimes referred to as belonging to the DDDD superfamily of phosphohydrolases.</td>

This family includes the N-terminal phosphatase domain of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). sEH is a bifunctional enzyme with two distinct enzyme activities, the C-terminal domain has epoxide hydrolysis activity and the N-terminal domain (Ntermphos), which belongs to this family, has lipid phosphatase activity. The latter prefers mono-phosphate esters, and lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are the best natural substrates found to date.  In addition this family includes Gallus gallus sEH and Xenopus sEH which appears to lack phosphatase activity, and Escherichia coli YihX/HAD4 which selectively hydrolyzes alpha-Glucose-1-P, phosphatase, has significant phosphatase activity against pyridoxal phosphate, and has low beta phosphoglucomutase activity.

            <td id=al>TIGR01549 haloacid dehalogenase superfamily, subfamily IA, variant 1 with third motif having Dx(3-4)D or Dx(3-4)E. This model represents part of one structural subfamily of the Haloacid Dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. The superfamily is defined by the presence of three short catalytic motifs. The subfamilies are defined based on the location and the observed or predicted fold of a so-called "capping domain", or the absence of such a domain. Subfamily I consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found in between the first and second catalytic motifs. Subfamily II consists of sequences in which the capping domain is found between the second and third motifs. Subfamily III sequences have no capping domain in either of these positions.The Subfamily IA and IB capping domains are predicted by PSI-PRED to consist of an alpha helical bundle. Subfamily I encompasses such a wide region of sequence space (the sequences are highly divergent) that representing it with a single model is impossible, resulting in an overly broad description which allows in many unrelated sequences. Subfamily IA and IB are separated based on an aparrent phylogenetic bifurcation. Subfamily IA is still too broad to model, but cannot be further subdivided into large chunks based on phylogenetic trees. Of the three motifs defining the HAD superfamily, the third has three variant forms: (1) hhhhsDxxx(x)(D/E), (2) hhhhssxxx(x)D and (3) hhhhDDxxx(x)s where _s_ refers to a small amino acid and _h_ to a hydrophobic one. All three of these variants are found in subfamily IA. Individual models were made based on seeds exhibiting only one of the variants each. Variant 1 (this model) is found in the enzymes phosphoglycolate phosphatase (TIGR01449) and enolase-phosphatase. These three variant models (see also TIGR01493 and TIGR01509) were created withthe knowledge that there will be overlap among them - this is by design and serves the purpose of eliminating the overlap with models of more distantly relatedHAD subfamilies caused by an overly broad single model.
