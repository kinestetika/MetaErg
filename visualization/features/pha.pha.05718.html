The presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ is required for catalytic activity. D-XK exists as a dimer with an active site that lies at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains.

Members of this subfamily contain two large domains separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site.

This family is predominantly composed of glycerol kinase (GK) and similar carbohydrate kinases including rhamnulokinase (RhuK), xylulokinase (XK), gluconokinase (GntK), ribulokinase (RBK), and fuculokinase (FK). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group, usually from ATP, to their carbohydrate substrates. The monomer of FGGY proteins contains two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. One domain is primarily involved in sugar substrate binding, and the other is mainly responsible for ATP binding. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. Substrate-induced conformational changes and a divalent cation may be required for the catalytic activity.</td>

Some uncharacterized sequences are also included in this subfamily. The prototypical member of this subfamily is Escherichia coli xylulokinase (EcXK), which exists as a dimer. Each monomer consists of two large domains separated by an open cleft that forms an active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. XKs do not have any known allosteric regulators, and they may have weak but significant activity in the absence of substrate. The presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ is required for catalytic activity. Members of this subfamily belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07770 Gluconate kinases; a subfamily of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. This subfamily is composed of a group of gluconate kinases (GntK, also known as gluconokinase; EC 2.7.1.12) encoded by the gntK gene, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of D-gluconate and produce 6-phospho-D-gluconate and ADP. The presence of Mg2+ might be required for catalytic activity. The prototypical member of this subfamily is GntK from Lactobacillus acidophilus. Unlike Escherichia coli GntK, which belongs to the superfamily of P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases, members in this subfamily are homologous to glycerol kinase, xylulose kinase, and rhamnulokinase from Escherichia coli. They have been classified as members of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, which contain two large domains separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model spans both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. Some uncharacterized homologous sequences are also included in this subfamily. The Lactobacillus gnt operon contains a single gntK gene. The gnt operons of some bacteria, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, have two gntK genes. For example, the C. glutamicum gnt operon has both a gluconate kinase gntV gene (also known as gntK) and a second hypothetical gntK gene (also known as gntK2). Both gluconate kinases encoded by these genes belong to this family, however the protein encoded by C. glutamicum gntV is not included in this model as it is truncated in the C-terminal domain.</td>

            <td id=al>cd07769 Glycerol kinases; a subfamily of the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases. This subfamily includes glycerol kinases (GK; EC 2.7.1.30) and glycerol kinase-like proteins from all three kingdoms of living organisms. Glycerol is an important intermediate of energy metabolism and it plays fundamental roles in several vital physiological processes. GKs are involved in the entry of external glycerol into cellular metabolism. They catalyze the rate-limiting step in glycerol metabolism by transferring a phosphate from ATP to glycerol thus producing glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) in the cytoplasm. Human GK deficiency, called hyperglycerolemia, is an X-linked recessive trait associated with psychomotor retardation, osteoporosis, spasticity, esotropia, and bone fractures. Under different conditions, GKs from different species may exist in different oligomeric states. The monomer of GKs is composed of two large domains separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. The high affinity ATP binding site of GKs is created only by a substrate-induced conformational change. Based on sequence similarity, some GK-like proteins from metazoa, which have lost their GK enzymatic activity, are also included in this CD. Members in this subfamily belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases.</td>
