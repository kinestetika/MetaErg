            <td id=al>cd04586 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the BON (bacterial OsmY and nodulation domain) domain. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the BON (bacterial OsmY and nodulation domain) domain. BON is a putative phospholipid-binding domain found in a family of osmotic shock protection proteins. It is also found in some secretins and a group of potential haemolysins. Its likely function is attachment to phospholipid membranes. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>cd04584 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the ACT domain. The putative Acetoin Utilization Protein (Acub) from Vibrio Cholerae contains a CBS pair domain.  The acetoin utilization protein plays a role in growth and sporulation on acetoin or butanediol for use as a carbon source. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms.  It is used as an external energy store by a number of fermentive bacteria. Acetoin is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be utilised in order to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA or 2,3-butanediol is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex and acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, respectively. Acetoin utilization proteins, acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, and histone deacetylases are members of an ancient protein superfamily.This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in the acetoin utilization proteins in bacteria. Acetoin is a product of fermentative metabolism in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms.  They produce acetoin as an external carbon storage compound and then later reuse it as a carbon and energy source during their stationary phase and sporulation. In addition these CBS domains are associated with a downstream ACT (aspartate kinase/chorismate mutase/TyrA) domain, which is linked to a wide range of metabolic enzymes that are regulated by amino acid concentration. Pairs of ACT domains bind specifically to a particular amino acid leading to regulation of the linked enzyme.

This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains of plant single cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) pair proteins (CBSX). CBSX1 and CBSX2 have been identified as redox regulators of the thioredoxin (Trx) system. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).</td>

            <td id=al>cd04631 CBS pair domains found in archeal 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase gamma subunit-like proteins. Archeal gamma-subunit of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contains four CBS domains in tandem repeats, similar to eukaryotic homologs. AMPK is an important regulator of metabolism and of energy homeostasis. It is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic serine/threonine kinase subunit (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta and gamma). The gamma subunit senses the intracellular energy status by competitively binding AMP and ATP and is believed to be responsible for allosteric regulation of the whole complex. In humans mutations in gamma- subunit of AMPK are associated with hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and glycogen storage in the skeletal muscle. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins.

Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domain, present in MUG70. The MUG70 protein, encoded by the Meiotically Up-regulated Gene 70, plays a role in meiosis and contains, beside the two CBS pairs, a PB1 domain. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.

            <td id=al>cd04613 Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the voltage gated CLC (chloride channel) in bacteria. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the voltage gated CLC voltage-gated chloride channel.  The CBS pairs here are found in the EriC CIC-type chloride channels in bacteria. These ion channels are proteins with a seemingly simple task of allowing the passive flow of chloride ions across biological membranes. CIC-type chloride channels come from all kingdoms of life, have several gene families, and can be gated by voltage. The members of the CIC-type chloride channel are double-barreled: two proteins forming homodimers at a broad interface formed by four helices from each protein. The two pores are not found at this interface, but are completely contained within each subunit, as deduced from the mutational analyses, unlike many other channels, in which four or five identical or structurally related subunits jointly form one pore.

This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in peptidase M50.  Members of the M50 metallopeptidase family include mammalian sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) site 2 proteases and various hypothetical bacterial homologues. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site.

            <td id=al>cd17779 signal transduction protein with CBS domains. Archeal gamma-subunit of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contains four CBS domains in tandem repeats, similar to eukaryotic homologs. AMPK is an important regulator of metabolism and of energy homeostasis. It is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic serine/threonine kinase subunit (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta and gamma). The gamma subunit senses the intracellular energy status by competitively binding AMP and ATP and is believed to be responsible for allosteric regulation of the whole complex. In humans mutations in gamma- subunit of AMPK are associated with hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and glycogen storage in the skeletal muscle.
