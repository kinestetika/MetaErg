            <td id=al>cd07570 Glutamine aminotransferase (GAT, glutaminase) domain of glutamine-dependent NAD synthetases (class 7 and 8 nitrilases). Glutamine-dependent NAD synthetases are bifunctional enzymes, which have an N-terminal GAT domain and a C-terminal NAD+ synthetase domain. The GAT domain is a glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2) which hydrolyses L-glutamine to L-glutamate and ammonia. The ammonia is used by the NAD+ synthetase domain in the ATP-dependent amidation of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide. Glutamine aminotransferases are categorized depending on their active site residues into different unrelated classes. This class of GAT domain belongs to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes, which depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad. This superfamily has been classified in the literature based on global and structure based sequence analysis into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13), this subgroup corresponds to classes 7 and 8. Members of this superfamily generally form homomeric complexes, the basic building block of which is a homodimer. Mycobacterium tuberculosis glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase forms a homooctamer.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00553 NAD+ synthase is a homodimer, which catalyzes the final step in de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis, an amide transfer from either ammonia or glutamine to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). The conversion of NaAD to NAD+ occurs via an NAD-adenylate intermediate and requires ATP and Mg2+. The intemediate is subsequently cleaved into NAD+ and AMP. In many prokaryotes, such as E. coli , NAD synthetase consists of a single domain and is strictly ammonia dependent. In contrast, eukaryotes and other prokaryotes have an additional N-terminal amidohydrolase domain that prefer glutamine, Interestingly, NAD+ synthases in these prokaryotes, can also utilize ammonia as an amide source .</td>

The member of this family from Bacillus subtilis is a strictly NH(3)-dependent NAD(+) synthetase of 272 amino acids. Proteins consisting only of the domain modeled here may be named as NH3-dependent NAD+ synthetase. Amidotransferase activity may reside in a separate protein, or not be present. Some other members of the family, such as from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are considerably longer, contain an apparent amidotransferase domain, and show glutamine-dependent as well as NH(3)-dependent activity.

            <td id=al>cd07197 Nitrilase superfamily, including nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes. This superfamily (also known as the C-N hydrolase superfamily) contains hydrolases that break carbon-nitrogen bonds; it includes nitrilases, cyanide dihydratases, aliphatic amidases, N-terminal amidases, beta-ureidopropionases, biotinidases, pantotheinase, N-carbamyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolases, the glutaminase domain of glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase, apolipoprotein N-acyltransferases, and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolases, among others. These enzymes depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad, and work through a thiol acylenzyme intermediate. Members of this superfamily generally form homomeric complexes, the basic building block of which is a homodimer. These oligomers include dimers, tetramers, hexamers, octamers, tetradecamers, octadecamers, as well as variable length helical arrangements and homo-oligomeric spirals. These proteins have roles in vitamin and co-enzyme metabolism, in detoxifying small molecules, in the synthesis of signaling molecules, and in the post-translational modification of proteins. They are used industrially, as biocatalysts in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industry, in cyanide remediation, and in the treatment of toxic effluent. This superfamily has been classified previously in the literature, based on global and structure-based sequence analysis, into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13). This hierarchy includes those thirteen classes and a few additional subfamilies. A putative distant relative, the plasmid-borne TraB family, has not been included in the hierarchy.</td>

MCI3434 R-amidase hydrolyzes (R,S)-piperazine-2-tert-butylcarboxamide to form (R)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid. It does so with strict R-stereoselectively. Its preferred substrates are carboxamide compounds which have the amino or imino group connected to their beta- or gamma-carbon. This subgroup belongs to a larger nitrilase superfamily comprised of nitrile- or amide-hydrolyzing enzymes and amide-condensing enzymes, which depend on a Glu-Lys-Cys catalytic triad. This superfamily has been classified in the literature based on global and structure based sequence analysis into thirteen different enzyme classes (referred to as 1-13), class 13 represents proteins that at the time were difficult to place in a distinct similarity group. It has been suggested that this subgroup represents a new class. Members of the nitrilase superfamily generally form homomeric complexes, the basic building block of which is a homodimer.
