            <td id=al>cd03053 GST_N family, Class Phi subfamily; composed of plant-specific class Phi GSTs and related fungal and bacterial proteins. GSTs are cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. The class Phi GST subfamily has experience extensive gene duplication. The Arabidopsis and Oryza genomes contain 13 and 16 Phi GSTs, respectively. They are primarily responsible for herbicide detoxification together with class Tau GSTs, showing class specificity in substrate preference. Phi enzymes are highly reactive toward chloroacetanilide and thiocarbamate herbicides. Some Phi GSTs have other functions including transport of flavonoid pigments to the vacuole, shoot regeneration and GSH peroxidase activity.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00570 Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, N-terminal domain; a large, diverse group of cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of  glutathione (GSH) with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. In addition, GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This family, also referred to as soluble GSTs, is the largest family of GSH transferases and is only distantly related to the mitochondrial GSTs (GSTK subfamily, a member of the DsbA family). Soluble GSTs bear no structural similarity to microsomal GSTs (MAPEG family) and display additional activities unique to their group, such as catalyzing thiolysis, reduction  and isomerization of certain compounds. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. Based on sequence similarity, different classes of GSTs have been identified, which display varying tissue distribution, substrate specificities and additional specific activities. In humans, GSTs display polymorphisms which may influence individual susceptibility to diseases such as cancer, arthritis, allergy and sclerosis. Some GST family members with non-GST functions include glutaredoxin 2, the CLIC subfamily of anion channels, prion protein Ure2p, crystallins, metaxin 2 and stringent starvation protein A.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03050 GST_N family, Class Theta subfamily; composed of eukaryotic class Theta GSTs and bacterial dichloromethane (DCM) dehalogenase. GSTs are cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. Mammalian class Theta GSTs show poor GSH conjugating activity towards the standard substrates, CDNB and ethacrynic acid, differentiating them from other mammalian GSTs. GSTT1-1 shows similar cataytic activity as bacterial DCM dehalogenase, catalyzing the GSH-dependent hydrolytic dehalogenation of dihalomethanes. This is an essential process in methylotrophic bacteria to enable them to use chloromethane and DCM as sole carbon and energy sources. The presence of polymorphisms in human GSTT1-1 and its relationship to the onset of diseases including cancer is subject of many studies. Human GSTT2-2 exhibits a highly specific sulfatase activity, catalyzing the cleavage of sulfate ions from aralkyl sufate esters, but not from aryl or alkyl sulfate esters.</td>

The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. Class Zeta GSTs, also known as maleylacetoacetate (MAA) isomerases, catalyze the isomerization of MAA to fumarylacetoacetate, the penultimate step in tyrosine/phenylalanine catabolism, using GSH as a cofactor. They show little GSH-conjugating activity towards traditional GST substrates but display modest GSH peroxidase activity. They are also implicated in the detoxification of the carcinogen dichloroacetic acid by catalyzing its dechlorination to glyoxylic acid.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03048 GST_N family, Ure2p-like subfamily; composed of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ure2p and related GSTs. Ure2p is a regulator for nitrogen catabolism in yeast. It represses the expression of several gene products involved in the use of poor nitrogen sources when rich sources are available. A transmissible conformational change of Ure2p results in a prion called [Ure3], an inactive, self-propagating and infectious amyloid. Ure2p displays a GST fold containing an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. The N-terminal TRX-fold domain is sufficient to induce the [Ure3] phenotype and is also called the prion domain of Ure2p. In addition to its role in nitrogen regulation, Ure2p confers protection to cells against heavy metal ion and oxidant toxicity, and shows glutathione (GSH) peroxidase activity. Characterized GSTs in this subfamily include Aspergillus fumigatus GSTs 1 and 2, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe GST-I. GSTs are cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of GSH with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.</td>

GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. The class Delta and Epsilon subfamily is made up primarily of insect GSTs, which play major roles in insecticide resistance by facilitating reductive dehydrochlorination of insecticides or conjugating them with GSH to produce water-soluble metabolites that are easily excreted. They are also implicated in protection against cellular damage by oxidative stress.</td>

The GST fold contains an N-terminal thioredoxin-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. GSH binds to the N-terminal domain while the hydrophobic substrate occupies a pocket in the C-terminal domain. Unlike mammalian GSTs which detoxify a broad range of compounds, the bacterial class Beta GSTs exhibit GSH conjugating activity with a narrow range of substrates. In addition to GSH conjugation, they are involved in the protection against oxidative stress and are able to bind antibiotics and reduce the antimicrobial activity of beta-lactam drugs, contributing to antibiotic resistance. The structure of the Proteus mirabilis enzyme reveals that the cysteine in the active site forms a covalent bond with GSH. One member of this subfamily is a GST from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 that is encoded by the bphK gene and is part of the biphenyl catabolic pathway.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03047 GST_N family, unknown subfamily 2; composed of uncharacterized bacterial proteins with similarity to GSTs. GSTs are cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. The sequence from Burkholderia cepacia was identified as part of a gene cluster involved in the degradation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Some GSTs (e.g. Class Zeta and Delta) are known to catalyze dechlorination reactions.</td>

            <td id=al>cd00299 C-terminal, alpha helical domain of the Glutathione S-transferase family. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, C-terminal alpha helical domain; a large, diverse group of cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of  glutathione (GSH) with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. In addition, GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This family, also referred to as soluble GSTs, is the largest family of GSH transferases and is only distantly related to the mitochondrial GSTs (GSTK). Soluble GSTs bear no structural similarity to microsomal GSTs (MAPEG family) and display additional activities unique to their group, such as catalyzing thiolysis, reduction  and isomerization of certain compounds. The GST fold contains an N-terminal thioredoxin-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. GSH binds to the N-terminal domain while the hydrophobic substrate occupies a pocket in the C-terminal domain. Based on sequence similarity, different classes of GSTs have been identified, which display varying tissue distribution, substrate specificities and additional specific activities. In humans, GSTs display polymorphisms which may influence individual susceptibility to diseases such as cancer, arthritis, allergy and sclerosis. Some GST family members with non-GST functions include glutaredoxin 2, the CLIC subfamily of anion channels, prion protein Ure2p, crystallins, metaxins, stringent starvation protein A, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03044 GST_N family, Gamma subunit of Elongation Factor 1B (EFB1gamma) subfamily; EF1Bgamma is part of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1 (EF1) complex which plays a central role in the elongation cycle during protein biosynthesis. EF1 consists of two functionally distinct units, EF1A and EF1B. EF1A catalyzes the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site concomitant with the hydrolysis of GTP. The resulting inactive EF1A:GDP complex is recycled to the active GTP form by the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor EF1B, a complex composed of at least two subunits, alpha and gamma. Metazoan EFB1 contain a third subunit, beta. The EF1B gamma subunit contains a GST fold consisting of an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain. The GST-like domain of EF1Bgamma is believed to mediate the dimerization of the EF1 complex, which in yeast is a dimer of the heterotrimer EF1A:EF1Balpha:EF1Bgamma. In addition to its role in protein biosynthesis, EF1Bgamma may also display other functions. The recombinant rice protein has been shown to possess GSH conjugating activity. The yeast EF1Bgamma binds membranes in a calcium dependent manner and is also part of a complex that binds to the msrA (methionine sulfoxide reductase) promoter suggesting a function in the regulation of its gene expression.</td>

            <td id=al>cd03058 GST_N family, Class Tau subfamily; GSTs are cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. The plant-specific class Tau GST subfamily has undergone extensive gene duplication. The Arabidopsis and Oryza genomes contain 28 and 40 Tau GSTs, respectively. They are primarily responsible for herbicide detoxification together with class Phi GSTs, showing class specificity in substrate preference. Tau enzymes are highly efficient in detoxifying diphenylether and aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides. In addition, Tau GSTs play important roles in intracellular signalling, biosynthesis of anthocyanin, responses to soil stresses and responses to auxin and cytokinin hormones.</td>
