            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of bacterial Serine/Threonine kinases, PknB and similar proteins. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily includes many bacterial eukaryotic-type STKs including Staphylococcus aureus PknB (also called PrkC or Stk1), Bacillus subtilis PrkC, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pkn proteins (PknB, PknD, PknE, PknF, PknL, and PknH), among others. S. aureus PknB is the only eukaryotic-type STK present in this species, although many microorganisms encode for several such proteins. It is important for the survival and pathogenesis of S. aureus as it is involved in the regulation of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, autolysis, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. M. tuberculosis PknB is essential for growth and it acts on diverse substrates including proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, cell division, transcription, stress responses, and metabolic regulation. B. subtilis PrkC is located at the inner membrane of endospores and functions to trigger spore germination. Bacterial STKs in this subfamily show varied domain architectures. The well-characterized members such as S. aureus and M. tuberculosis PknB, and B. subtilis PrkC, contain an N-terminal cytosolic  kinase domain, a transmembrane (TM) segment, and mutliple C-terminal extracellular PASTA domains. The PknB subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic kinase domain of Myosin Light Chain Kinase-like Serine/Threonine Kinases. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This family is composed of MLCKs and related MLCK-like kinase domains from giant STKs such as titin, obscurin, SPEG, Unc-89, Trio, kalirin, and Twitchin. Also included in this family are Death-Associated Protein Kinases (DAPKs) and Death-associated protein kinase-Related Apoptosis-inducing protein Kinase (DRAKs). MLCK phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain and controls the contraction of all muscle types. Titin, obscurin, Twitchin, and SPEG are muscle proteins involved in the contractile apparatus. The giant STKs are multidomain proteins containing immunoglobulin (Ig), fibronectin type III (FN3), SH3, RhoGEF, PH and kinase domains. Titin, obscurin, Twitchin, and SPEG contain many Ig domain repeats at the N-terminus, while Trio and Kalirin contain spectrin-like repeats. The MLCK-like family is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of Protein Kinases. PKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine or tyrosine residues on protein substrates. PKs make up a large family of serine/threonine kinases (STKs), protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), and dual-specificity PKs that phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues of target proteins. Majority of protein phosphorylation occurs on serine residues while only 1% occurs on tyrosine residues. Protein phosphorylation is a mechanism by which a wide variety of cellular proteins, such as enzymes and membrane channels, are reversibly regulated in response to certain stimuli. PKs often function as components of signal transduction pathways in which one kinase activates a second kinase, which in turn, may act on other kinases; this sequential action transmits a signal from the cell surface to target proteins, which results in cellular responses. The PK family is one of the largest known protein families with more than 100 homologous yeast enzymes and more than 500 human proteins. A fraction of PK family members are pseudokinases that lack crucial residues for catalytic activity. The mutiplicity of kinases allows for specific regulation according to substrate, tissue distribution, and cellular localization. PKs regulate many cellular processes including proliferation, division, differentiation, motility, survival, metabolism, cell-cycle progression, cytoskeletal rearrangement, immunity, and neuronal functions. Many kinases are implicated in the development of various human diseases including different types of cancer. The PK family is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and actin-fragmin kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of fungal Rim15-like Protein Serine/Threonine Kinases. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Members of this group include Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rim15, Schizosaccharomyces pombe cek1, and similar fungal proteins. They contain a central catalytic domain, which contains an insert relative to MAST kinases. In addition, Rim15 contains a C-terminal signal receiver (REC) domain while cek1 contains an N-terminal PAS domain. Rim15 (or Rim15p) functions as a regulator of meiosis. It acts as a downstream effector of PKA and regulates entry into stationary phase (G0). Thus, it plays a crucial role in regulating yeast proliferation, differentiation, and aging. Cek1 may facilitate progression of mitotic anaphase. The Rim15-like subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of testis-specific serine/threonine kinases and similar proteins. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. TSSK proteins are almost exclusively expressed postmeiotically in the testis and play important roles in spermatogenesis and/or spermiogenesis. There are five mammalian TSSK proteins which show differences in their localization and timing of expression. TSSK1 and TSSK2 are expressed specifically in meiotic and postmeiotic spermatogenic cells, respectively. TSSK3 has been reported to be expressed in the interstitial Leydig cells of adult testis.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. CaMKs are multifunctional calcium and calmodulin (CaM) stimulated STKs involved in cell cycle regulation. There are several types of CaMKs including CaMKI, CaMKII, and CaMKIV. CaMKI proteins are monomeric and they play pivotal roles in the nervous system, including long-term potentiation, dendritic arborization, neurite outgrowth, and the formation of spines, synapses, and axons. CaMKII is a signaling molecule that translates upstream calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals into downstream responses that play important roles in synaptic function and cardiovascular physiology. CAMKIV is implicated in regulating several transcription factors like CREB, MEF2, and retinoid orphan receptors, as well as in T-cell development and signaling. The CAMK family also consists of other related kinases including the Phosphorylase kinase Gamma subunit (PhKG), the C-terminal kinase domains of Ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and Mitogen and stress-activated kinase (MSK), Doublecortin-like kinase (DCKL), and the MAPK-activated protein kinases MK2, MK3, and MK5, among others.

AGC kinases regulate many cellular processes including division, growth, survival, metabolism, motility, and differentiation. Many are implicated in the development of various human diseases. Members of this family include cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKA), cGMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKG), Protein Kinase C (PKC), Protein Kinase B (PKB), G protein-coupled Receptor Kinase (GRK), Serum- and Glucocorticoid-induced Kinase (SGK), and 70 kDa ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase (p70S6K or S6K), among others. AGC kinases share an activation mechanism based on the phosphorylation of up to three sites: the activation loop (A-loop), the hydrophobic motif (HM) and the turn motif. Phosphorylation at the A-loop is required of most AGC kinases, which results in a disorder-to-order transition of the A-loop. The ordered conformation results in the access of substrates and ATP to the active site. A subset of AGC kinases with C-terminal extensions containing the HM also requires phosphorylation at this site. Phosphorylation at the HM allows the C-terminal extension to form an ordered structure that packs into the hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic domain, which then reconfigures the kinase into an active bi-lobed state. In addition, growth factor-activated AGC kinases such as PKB, p70S6K, RSK, MSK, PKC, and SGK, require phosphorylation at the turn motif (also called tail or zipper site), located N-terminal to the HM at the C-terminal extension. The AGC family is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase.</td>

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. The nematode Unc-89 gene, through alternative promoter use and splicing, encodes at least six major isoforms (Unc-89A to Unc-89F) of giant muscle proteins that are homologs for the vetebrate obscurin. In flies, five isoforms of Unc-89 have been detected: four in the muscles of adult flies (two in the indirect flight muscle and two in other muscles) and another isoform in the larva. Unc-89 in nematodes is required for normal muscle cell architecture. In flies, it is necessary for the development of a symmetrical sarcomere in the flight muscles. Unc-89 proteins contain several adhesion and signaling domains including multiple copies of the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, as well as fibronectin type III (FN3), SH3, RhoGEF, and PH domains. The nematode Unc-89 isoforms D, C, D, and F contain two kinase domain with B and F having two complete kinase domains while the first repeat of C and D are partial domains. Homology modeling suggests that the first kinase repeat of Unc-89 may be catalytically inactive, a pseudokinase, while the second kinase repeat may be active.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily is composed of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases, PKA and PRKX, and similar proteins. The inactive PKA holoenzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two phosphorylated and active catalytic subunits with a dimer of regulatory (R) subunits. Activation is achieved through the binding of the important second messenger cAMP to the R subunits, which leads to the dissociation of PKA into the R dimer and two active subunits. PKA is present ubiquitously in cells and interacts with many different downstream targets. It plays a role in the regulation of diverse processes such as growth, development, memory, metabolism, gene expression, immunity, and lipolysis. PRKX is also reulated by the R subunit and is is present in many tissues including fetal and adult brain, kidney, and lung. It is implicated in granulocyte/macrophage lineage differentiation, renal cell epithelial migration, and tubular morphogenesis in the developing kidney.

Altered GRK2 expression has been reported in several disorders including major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Parkinsonism. GRK2 contains an N-terminal RGS homology (RH) domain, a central catalytic domain, and C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that mediates PIP2 and G protein betagamma-subunit translocation to the membrane.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of inactive phosphorylase b to form the active phosphorylase a. It coordinates hormonal, metabolic, and neuronal signals to initiate the breakdown of glycogen stores, which enables the maintenance of blood-glucose homeostasis during fasting, and is also used as a source of energy for muscle contraction. PhK is one of the largest and most complex protein kinases, composed of a heterotetramer containing four molecules each of four subunit types: one catalytic (gamma) and three regulatory (alpha, beta, and delta). The gamma 2 subunit (PhKG2) is also referred to as the testis/liver gamma isoform. Mutations in its gene cause autosomal-recessive glycogenosis of the liver. The gamma subunit, when isolated, is constitutively active and does not require phosphorylation of the A-loop for activity. The regulatory subunits restrain this kinase activity until signals are received to relieve this inhibition. For example, the kinase is activated in response to hormonal stimulation, after autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase of the alpha and beta subunits. The high-affinity binding of ADP to the beta subunit also stimulates kinase activity, whereas calcium relieves inhibition by binding to the delta (calmodulin) subunit.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. MAPK signal-integrating kinases (Mnks) are MAPK-activated protein kinases and is comprised by a group of four proteins, produced by alternative splicing from two genes (Mnk1 and Mnk2). The isoforms of Mnk1 (1a/1b) and Mnk2 (2a/2b) differ at their C-termini, with the a-form having a longer C-terminus containing a MAPK-binding region. All Mnks contain a catalytic kinase domain and a polybasic region at the N-terminus which binds importin and the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G. The best characterized Mnk substrate is eIF4G, whose phosphorylation may promote the export of certain mRNAs from the nucleus. Mnk also phosphorylate substrates that bind to AU-rich elements that regulate mRNA stability and translation. Mnks have also been implicated in tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, inflammation, and cell prolieration or survival.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. MSKs contain an N-terminal kinase domain (NTD) from the AGC family and a C-terminal kinase domain (CTD) from the CAMK family. MSKs are activated by two major signaling cascades, the Ras-MAPK and p38 stress kinase pathways, in response to various stimuli such as growth factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, cellular stress, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This triggers phosphorylation in the activation loop (A-loop) of the CTD of MSK. The active CTD phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif (HM) in the C-terminal extension of NTD, which facilitates the phosphorylation of the A-loop and activates the NTD, which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets. MSKs are predominantly nuclear proteins. They are widely expressed in many tissues including heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas. There are two isoforms of MSK, called MSK1 and MSK2.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of inactive phosphorylase b to form the active phosphorylase a. It coordinates hormonal, metabolic, and neuronal signals to initiate the breakdown of glycogen stores, which enables the maintenance of blood-glucose homeostasis during fasting, and is also used as a source of energy for muscle contraction. PhK is one of the largest and most complex protein kinases, composed of a heterotetramer containing four molecules each of four subunit types: one catalytic (gamma) and three regulatory (alpha, beta, and delta). The gamma 1 subunit (PhKG1) is also referred to as the muscle gamma isoform. The gamma subunit, when isolated, is constitutively active and does not require phosphorylation of the A-loop for activity. The regulatory subunits restrain this kinase activity until signals are received to relieve this inhibition. For example, the kinase is activated in response to hormonal stimulation, after autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase of the alpha and beta subunits. The high-affinity binding of ADP to the beta subunit also stimulates kinase activity, whereas calcium relieves inhibition by binding to the delta (calmodulin) subunit. The PhKG1 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

Vertebrates contain at least 2 Aurora kinases (A and B); mammals contains a third Aurora kinase gene (C). This subfamily includes Aurora-B and Aurora-C. Aurora-B is most active at the transition during metaphase to the end of mitosis. It associates with centromeres, relocates to the midzone of the central spindle, and concentrates at the midbody during cell division. It is critical for accurate chromosomal segregation, cytokinesis, protein localization to the centrosome and kinetochore, correct microtubule-kinetochore attachments, and regulation of the mitotic checkpoint. Aurora-C is mainly expressed in meiotically dividing cells; it was originally discovered in mice as a testis-specific STK called Aie1. Both Aurora-B and -C are chromosomal passenger proteins that can form complexes with INCENP and survivin, and they may have redundant cellular functions.

Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of inactive phosphorylase b to form the active phosphorylase a. It coordinates hormonal, metabolic, and neuronal signals to initiate the breakdown of glycogen stores, which enables the maintenance of blood-glucose homeostasis during fasting, and is also used as a source of energy for muscle contraction. PhK is one of the largest and most complex protein kinases, composed of a heterotetramer containing four molecules each of four subunit types: one catalytic (gamma) and three regulatory (alpha, beta, and delta). Each subunit has tissue-specific isoforms or splice variants. Vertebrates contain two isoforms of the gamma subunit (gamma 1 and gamma 2). The gamma subunit, when isolated, is constitutively active and does not require phosphorylation of the A-loop for activity. The regulatory subunits restrain this kinase activity until signals are received to relieve this inhibition. For example, the kinase is activated in response to hormonal stimulation, after autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase of the alpha and beta subunits. The high-affinity binding of ADP to the beta subunit also stimulates kinase activity, whereas calcium relieves inhibition by binding to the delta (calmodulin) subunit.

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. GRKs phosphorylate and regulate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest superfamily of cell surface receptors, which regulate some part of nearly all physiological functions.

GRKs play important roles in the cardiovascular, immune, respiratory, skeletal, and nervous systems. They contain a central catalytic domain, flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions. The N-terminus contains an RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) homology (RH) domain and several motifs. The C-terminus diverges among different groups of GRKs. There are seven types of GRKs, named GRK1 to GRK7, which are subdivided into three main groups: visual (GRK1/7); beta-adrenergic receptor kinases (GRK2/3); and GRK4-like (GRK4/5/6). Expression of GRK2/3/5/6 is widespread while GRK1/4/7 show a limited tissue distribution. The substrate spectrum of the widely expressed GRKs partially overlaps.

MSK2 is the required H3 kinase in response to stress stimuli and activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. MSK2 also plays a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. MSKs contain an N-terminal kinase domain (NTD) from the AGC family and a C-terminal kinase domain (CTD) from the CAMK family, similar to 90 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs). MSKs are activated by two major signaling cascades, the Ras-MAPK and p38 stress kinase pathways, which trigger phosphorylation in the activation loop (A-loop) of the CTD of MSK. The active CTD phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif (HM) of NTD, which facilitates the phosphorylation of the A-loop and activates the NTD, which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets.

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine kinases, Interleukin-1 Receptor Associated Kinases and related STKs. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. IRAKs are involved in Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) signalling pathways, and are thus critical in regulating innate immune responses and inflammation. Some IRAKs may also play roles in T- and B-cell signaling, and adaptive immunity. Vertebrates contain four IRAKs (IRAK-1, -2, -3 (or -M), and -4) that display distinct functions and patterns of expression and subcellular distribution, and can differentially mediate TLR signaling. IRAK-1, -2, and -4 are ubiquitously expressed and are active kinases, while IRAK-M is only induced in monocytes and macrophages and is an inactive kinase. Variations in IRAK genes are linked to diverse diseases including infection, sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. IRAKs contain an N-terminal Death domain (DD), a proST region (rich in serines, prolines, and threonines), a central kinase domain (a pseudokinase domain in the case of IRAK3), and a C-terminal domain; IRAK-4 lacks the C-terminal domain. This subfamily includes plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including Arabidopsis thaliana BAK1 and CLAVATA1 (CLV1). BAK1 functions in BR (brassinosteroid)-regulated plant development and in pathways involved in plant resistance to pathogen infection and herbivore attack.  CLV1, directly binds small signaling peptides, CLAVATA3 (CLV3) and CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGI0N (CLE), to restrict stem cell proliferation: the CLV3-CLV1-WUS (WUSCHEL) module influences stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem, and the CLE40 (CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION40) -ACR4 (CRINKLY4) -CLV1- WOX5 (WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX5) module at the root apical meristem.

Unc-89 in nematodes is required for normal muscle cell architecture. In flies, it is necessary for the development of a symmetrical sarcomere in the flight muscles. Unc-89 proteins contain several adhesion and signaling domains including multiple copies of the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, as well as fibronectin type III (FN3), SH3, RhoGEF, and PH domains. The nematode Unc-89 isoforms D, C, D, and F contain two kinase domain with B and F having two complete kinase domains while the first repeat of C and D are partial domains. Homology modeling suggests that the first kinase repeat of Unc-89 may be catalytically inactive, a pseudokinase, while the second kinase repeat may be active. The pseudokinase domain may function as a regulatory domain or a protein interaction domain. The Unc-89 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>

            <td id=al>Catalytic domain of Fungal Halotolerance protein 4-like Serine/Threonine kinases. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily is composed of HAL4, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ptk2/Stk2, and similar fungal proteins. Proteins in this subfamily are involved in regulating ion transporters. In budding and fission yeast, HAL4 promotes potassium ion uptake, which increases cellular resistance to other cations such as sodium, lithium, and calcium ions. HAL4 stabilizes the major high-affinity K+ transporter Trk1 at the plasma membrane under low K+ conditions, which prevents endocytosis and vacuolar degradation. Budding yeast Ptk2 phosphorylates and regulates the plasma membrane H+ ATPase, Pma1. The HAL4-like subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td>
