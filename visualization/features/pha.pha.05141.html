            <td id=al>Glycosyltransferase family A (GT-A) includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are enzymes that synthesize oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates by transferring the sugar moiety from an activated nucleotide-sugar donor to an acceptor molecule, which may be a growing oligosaccharide, a lipid, or a protein.  Based on the stereochemistry of the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins. But it also includes families GT-43, GT-6, GT-8, GT13 and GT-7; which are evolutionarily related to GT-2 and share structure similarities.</td>

Cellulose synthase catalyzes the polymerization reaction of cellulose, an aggregate of unbranched polymers of beta-1,4-linked glucose residues in  plants, most algae, some bacteria and fungi, and even some animals. In bacteria, algae and lower eukaryotes, there is a second unrelated type of cellulose synthase (Type II), which produces acylated cellulose, a derivative of cellulose. Chitin synthase catalyzes the incorporation of GlcNAc from substrate UDP-GlcNAc into chitin, which is a linear homopolymer of beta-(1,4)-linked GlcNAc residues and Glucan Biosynthesis protein catalyzes the elongation of beta-1,2 polyglucose chains of Glucan.</td>

            <td id=al>N-terminal domain of Chondroitin polymerase functions as a GalNAc transferase. Chondroitin polymerase is a two domain, bi-functional protein. The N-terminal domain functions as a GalNAc transferase. The bacterial chondroitin polymerase catalyzes elongation of the chondroitin chain by alternatively transferring the GlcUA and GalNAc moiety from UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc to the non-reducing ends of the chondroitin chain. The enzyme consists of N-terminal and C-terminal domains in which the two active sites catalyze the addition of GalNAc and GlcUA, respectively. Chondroitin chains range from 40 to over 100 repeating units of the disaccharide. Sulfated chondroitins are involved in the regulation of various biological functions such as central nervous system development, wound repair, infection, growth factor signaling, and morphogenesis, in addition to its conventional structural roles. In Caenorhabditis elegans, chondroitin is an essential factor for the worm to undergo cytokinesis and cell division. Chondroitin is synthesized as proteoglycans, sulfated and secreted to the cell surface or extracellular matrix.</td>

DPM synthase is required for synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, N-glycan precursor, protein O-mannose, and C-mannose. The enzyme has three subunits, DPM1, DPM2 and DPM3. DPM is synthesized from dolichol phosphate and GDP-Man on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane by DPM synthase and then is flipped onto the luminal side and used as a donor substrate.

Human Beta3GnTL1 is a putative beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. Beta3GnTL1 is expressed at various levels in most of tissues examined. Beta 1, 3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase has been found to be essential for the formation of poly-N-acetyllactosamine. Poly-N-acetyllactosamine is a unique carbohydrate composed of N-acetyllactosamine repeats. It is often an important part of cell-type-specific oligosaccharide structures and some functional oligosaccharides. It has been shown that the structure and biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine display a dramatic change during development and oncogenesis. Several members of beta-1, 3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase have been identified.</td>

DPM synthase is required for synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, N-glycan precursor, protein O-mannose, and C-mannose. In higher eukaryotes,the enzyme has three subunits, DPM1, DPM2 and DPM3. DPM is synthesized from dolichol phosphate and GDP-Man on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane by DPM synthase and then is flipped onto the luminal side and used as a donor substrate. In lower eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trypanosoma brucei, DPM synthase consists of a single component (Dpm1p and TbDpm1, respectively) that possesses one predicted transmembrane region near the C terminus for anchoring to the ER membrane. In contrast, the Dpm1 homologues of higher eukaryotes, namely fission yeast, fungi, and animals, have no transmembrane region, suggesting the existence of adapter molecules for membrane anchoring. This family also includes bacteria and archaea DPM1_like enzymes. However, the enzyme structure and mechanism of function are not well understood. The UDP-glucose:dolichyl-phosphate glucosyltransferase (DPG_synthase) is a transmembrane-bound enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum involved in protein N-linked glycosylation. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to dolichyl phosphate. This protein family belongs to Glycosyltransferase 2 superfamily.</td>
