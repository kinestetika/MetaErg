HSP70 (70-kDa heat shock protein) family chaperones assist in protein folding and assembly and can direct incompetent "client" proteins towards degradation. Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. HSP70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Some HSP70 family members are not chaperones but instead, function as NEFs to remove ADP from their HSP70 chaperone partners during the ATP hydrolysis cycle, some may function as both chaperones and NEFs.</td>

This subfamily includes human HSPA5 (also known as 70-kDa heat shock protein 5, glucose-regulated protein 78/GRP78, and immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein/BIP, MIF2; the gene encoding HSPA5 maps to 9q33.3.), Sacchaormyces cerevisiae Kar2p (also known as Grp78p), and related proteins. This subfamily belongs to the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of chaperones that assist in protein folding and assembly and can direct incompetent "client" proteins towards degradation. HSPA5 and Kar2p are chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. HSP70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Multiple ER DNAJ domain proteins have been identified and may exist in distinct complexes with HSPA5 in various locations in the ER, for example DNAJC3-p58IPK in the lumen. HSPA5-NEFs include SIL1 and an atypical HSP70 family protein HYOU1/ORP150. The ATPase activity of Kar2p is stimulated by the NEFs: Sil1p and Lhs1p.</td>

            <td id=al>cd11733 Nucleotide-binding domain of human HSPA9, Escherichia coli DnaK, and similar proteins. This subgroup includes human mitochondrial HSPA9 (also known as 70-kDa heat shock protein 9, CSA; MOT; MOT2; GRP75; PBP74; GRP-75; HSPA9B; MTHSP75; the gene encoding HSPA9 maps to 5q31.1), Escherichia coli DnaK, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Stress-Seventy subfamily C/Ssc1p (also called mtHSP70, Endonuclease SceI 75 kDa subunit). It belongs to the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of chaperones that assist in protein folding and assembly, and can direct incompetent "client" proteins towards degradation. Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Hsp70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs); for Escherichia coli DnaK, these are the DnaJ and GrpE, respectively. HSPA9 is involved in multiple processses including mitochondrial import, antigen processing, control of cellular proliferation and differentiation, and regulation of glucose responses. During glucose deprivation-induced cellular stress, HSPA9 plays an important role in the suppression of apoptosis by inhibiting a conformational change in Bax that allow the release of cytochrome c. DnaK modulates the heat shock response in Escherichia coli. It protects E. coli from protein carbonylation, an irreversible oxidative modification that increases during organism aging and bacterial growth arrest. Under severe thermal stress, it functions as part of a bi-chaperone system: the DnaK system and the ring-forming AAA+ chaperone ClpB (Hsp104) system, to promote cell survival. DnaK has also been shown to cooperate with GroEL and the ribosome-associated Escherichia coli Trigger Factor in the proper folding of cytosolic proteins. S. cerevisiae Ssc1p is the major HSP70 chaperone of the mitochondrial matrix, promoting translocation of proteins from the cytosol, across the inner membrane, to the matrix, and their subsequent folding. Ssc1p interacts with Tim44, a peripheral inner membrane protein associated with the TIM23 protein translocase. It is also a subunit of the endoSceI site-specific endoDNase and is required for full endoSceI activity. Ssc1p plays roles in the import of Yfh1p, a nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis (and a homolog of human frataxin, implicated in the neurodegenerative disease, Friedreich's ataxia). Ssc1 also participates in translational regulation of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) biogenesis by interacting with Mss51 and Mss51-containing complexes.</td>

Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD.

ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. HSP70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). STCH contains an NBD but lacks an SBD. STCH may function to regulate cell proliferation and survival, and modulate the TRAIL-mediated cell death pathway. The HSPA13 gene is a candidate stomach cancer susceptibility gene; a mutation in the NBD coding region of HSPA13 has been identified in stomach cancer cells. The NBD of HSPA13 interacts with the ubiquitin-like proteins Chap1 and Chap2, implicating HSPA13 in regulating cell cycle and cell death events. HSPA13 is induced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187.</td>

This subfamily also includes human HSPA8 (heat shock 70kDa protein 8, also known as LAP1; HSC54; HSC70; HSC71; HSP71; HSP73; NIP71; HSPA10; the HSPA8 gene maps to 11q24.1), human HSPA2 (70-kDa heat shock protein 2, also known as HSP70-2; HSP70-3, the HSPA2 gene maps to 14q24.1), human HSPA6 (also known as heat shock 70kDa protein 6 (HSP70B') gi 94717614, the HSPA6 gene maps to 1q23.3), human HSPA7 (heat shock 70kDa protein 7 , also known as HSP70B; the HSPA7 gene maps to 1q23.3) and Saccharmoyces cerevisiae Stress-Seventy subfamily B/Ssb1p. This subfamily belongs to the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of chaperones that assist in protein folding and assembly and can direct incompetent "client" proteins towards degradation. Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. HSP70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Associations of polymorphisms within the MHC-III HSP70 gene locus with longevity, systemic lupus erythematosus, Meniere's disease, noise-induced hearing loss, high-altitude pulmonary edema, and coronary heart disease, have been found. HSPA2 is involved in cancer cell survival, is required for maturation of male gametophytes, and is linked to male infertility. The induction of HSPA6 is a biomarker of cellular stress. HSPA8 participates in the folding and trafficking of client proteins to different subcellular compartments, and in the signal transduction and apoptosis process; it has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress partly through an interaction with alpha-enolase. S. cerevisiae Ssb1p, is part of the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), it acts as a chaperone for nascent polypeptides, and is important for translation fidelity; Ssb1p is also a [PSI+] prion-curing factor.</td>

            <td id=al>cd10228 Nucleotide-binding domain of 105/110 kDa heat shock proteins including HSPA4 and similar proteins. This subgroup includes the human proteins, HSPA4 (also known as 70-kDa heat shock protein 4, APG-2, HS24/P52, hsp70 RY, and HSPH2; the human HSPA4 gene maps to 5q31.1), HSPA4L (also known as 70-kDa heat shock protein 4-like, APG-1, HSPH3, and OSP94; the human HSPA4L gene maps to 4q28), and HSPH1 (also known as heat shock 105kDa/110kDa protein 1, HSP105; HSP105A; HSP105B; NY-CO-25; the human HSPH1 gene maps to 13q12.3), Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sse1p and Sse2p, and a sea urchin sperm receptor. It belongs to the 105/110 kDa heat shock protein (HSP105/110) subfamily of the HSP70-like family, and includes proteins believed to function generally as co-chaperones of HSP70 chaperones, acting as nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs), to remove ADP from their HSP70 chaperone partners during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. HSP70 chaperones assist in protein folding and assembly, and can direct incompetent "client" proteins towards degradation. Like HSP70 chaperones, HSP105/110s have an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD). For HSP70 chaperones, the nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Hsp70 chaperone activity is also regulated by J-domain proteins.</td>

            <td id=al>cd10238 Nucleotide-binding domain of human HSPA14 and similar proteins. Human HSPA14 (also known as 70-kDa heat shock protein 14, HSP70L1, HSP70-4; the gene encoding HSPA14 maps to 10p13), is ribosome-associated and belongs to the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of chaperones that assist in protein folding and assembly, and can direct incompetent "client" proteins towards degradation. Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. HSP70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). HSPA14 interacts with the J-protein MPP11 to form the mammalian ribosome-associated complex (mRAC). HSPA14 participates in a pathway along with Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1, also known as p85 or nibrin), heat shock transcription factor 4b (HSF4b), and HSPA4 (belonging to a different subfamily), that induces tumor migration, invasion, and transformation. HSPA14 is a potent T helper cell (Th1) polarizing adjuvant that contributes to antitumor immune responses.</td>

            <td id=al>cd10229 Nucleotide-binding domain of HSPA12A, HSPA12B and similar proteins. Human HSPA12A (also known as 70-kDa heat shock protein-12A) and HSPA12B (also known as 70-kDa heat shock protein-12B, chromosome 20 open reading frame 60/C20orf60, dJ1009E24.2) belong to the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of chaperones that assist in protein folding and assembly, and can direct incompetent "client" proteins towards degradation. Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. HSP70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). No co-chaperones have yet been identified for HSPA12A or HSPA12B. The gene encoding HSPA12A maps to 10q26.12, a cytogenetic region that might represent a common susceptibility locus for both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder; reduced expression of HSPA12A has been shown in the prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia. HSPA12A is also a candidate gene for forelimb-girdle muscular anomaly, an autosomal recessive disorder of Japanese black cattle. HSPA12A is predominantly expressed in neuronal cells. It may also play a role in the atherosclerotic process. The gene encoding HSPA12B maps to 20p13. HSPA12B is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells, is required for angiogenesis, and may interact with known angiogenesis mediators. It may be important for host defense in microglia-mediated immune response. HSPA12B expression is up-regulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in the spinal cord, and mostly located in active microglia; this induced expression may be regulated by activation of MAPK-p38, ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK signaling pathways. Overexpression of HSPA12B also protects against LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction and involves the preserved activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</td>

            <td id=al>cd10230 Nucleotide-binding domain of human HYOU1 and similar proteins. This subgroup includes human HYOU1 (also known as human hypoxia up-regulated 1, GRP170; HSP12A; ORP150; GRP-170; ORP-150; the human HYOU1 gene maps to11q23.1-q23.3) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Lhs1p (also known as Cer1p, SsI1). Mammalian HYOU1 functions as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) for HSPA5 (alos known as BiP, Grp78 or HspA5) and may also function as a HSPA5-independent chaperone. S. cerevisiae Lhs1p, does not have a detectable endogenous ATPase activity like canonical HSP70s, but functions as a NEF for Kar2p; it's interaction with Kar2p is stimulated by nucleotide-binding. In addition, Lhs1p has a nucleotide-independent holdase activity that prevents heat-induced aggregation of proteins in vitro. This subgroup belongs to the 105/110 kDa heat shock protein (HSP105/110) subfamily of the HSP70-like family. HSP105/110s are believed to function generally as co-chaperones of HSP70 chaperones, acting as NEFs, to remove ADP from their HSP70 chaperone partners during the ATP hydrolysis cycle.
