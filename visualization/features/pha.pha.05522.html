This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli or Vibrio cholera PhoR, the histidine kinase (HK) of PhoB-PhoR a two-component signal transduction system (TCS) involved in phosphate regulation. PhoR monitors extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability and PhoB, the response regulator, regulates transcription of genes of the phosphate regulon. PhoR is a bifunctional histidine autokinase/phospho-PhoB phosphatase; in phosphate deficiency, it autophosphorylates and Pi is transferred to PhoB, and when environmental Pi is abundant, it removes the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated PhoB. Other roles of PhoB-PhoR TCS have been described, including motility, biofilm formation, intestinal colonization, and virulence in V. cholera. E.coli PhoR and Bacillus subtilis PhoR (whose HATPase domain belongs to a different family) sense very different signals in each bacterium. In E. coli the PhoR signal comes from phosphate transport mediated by the PstSCAB2 phosphate transporter and the PhoU chaperone-like protein while in B. subtilis, the PhoR activation signal comes from wall teichoic acid (WTA) metabolism.</td>

This family includes histidine kinase-like ATPase (HATPase) domain of two-component sensor histidine kinases similar to Escherichia coli PhoQ and Providencia stuartii AarG. PhoQ is the histidine kinase (HK) of the PhoP-PhoQ two-component regulatory system (TCS), which responds to the levels of Mg2+ and Ca2+, controls virulence, mediates the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments, and regulates numerous cellular activities. Providencia stuartii AarG is a putative sensor kinase which controls the expression of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase and an intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) response in Providencia stuartii. The AarG product is similar to PhoQ in that it is able to restore wild-type levels of resistance to a Salmonella typhimurium phoQ mutant. However, the expression of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase gene and of aarP (a gene encoding a transcriptional activator of 2'-N-acetyltransferase) are not significantly affected by the levels of Mg2+ or Ca2+. Most proteins in this group contain a histidine kinase dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain (HisKA); some have an accessory HAMP sensor domain, and some have an intracellular membrane -interaction PhoQ sensor domain.</td>
