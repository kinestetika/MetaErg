The common reaction mechanism catalyzed by MoeB and ThiF, like other E1 enzymes, begins with a nucleophilic attack of the C-terminal carboxylate of MoaD and ThiS, respectively, on the alpha-phosphate of an ATP molecule bound at the active site of the activating enzymes, leading to the formation of a high-energy acyladenylate intermediate and subsequently to the formation of  a thiocarboxylate at the C termini of MoaD and ThiS. MoeB, as the MPT synthase (MoaE/MoaD complex) sulfurase, is involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor, a derivative of the tricyclic pterin, molybdopterin (MPT). ThiF catalyzes the adenylation of ThiS, as part of the biosynthesis pathway of thiamin pyrophosphate (vitamin B1). </td>

            <td id=al>Ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), repeat 2-like. E1, a highly conserved small protein present universally in eukaryotic cells, is part of cascade to attach ubiquitin (Ub) covalently to substrate proteins. This cascade consists of activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and/or ligating (E3) enzymes and then targets them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. E1 activates ubiquitin by C-terminal adenylation, and subsequently forms a highly reactive thioester bond between its catalytic cysteine and ubiquitin's C-terminus. E1 also associates with E2 and promotes ubiquitin transfer to the E2's catalytic cysteine. A set of novel molecules with a structural similarity to Ub, called Ub-like proteins (Ubls), have similar conjugation cascades. In contrast to ubiquitin-E1, which is a single-chain protein with a weakly conserved two-fold repeat, many of the Ubls-E1are a heterodimer where each subunit corresponds to one half of a single-chain E1. This CD represents the family homologous to the second repeat of Ub-E1.</td>

E1, a highly conserved small protein present universally in eukaryotic cells, is part of cascade to attach ubiquitin (Ub) covalently to substrate proteins. This cascade consists of activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and/or ligating (E3) enzymes and then targets them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. E1 activates ubiquitin by C-terminal adenylation, and subsequently forms a highly reactive thioester bond between its catalytic cysteine and ubiquitin's C-terminus. E1 also associates with E2 and promotes ubiquitin transfer to the E2's catalytic cysteine. Ubiquitin-E1 is a single-chain protein with a weakly conserved two-fold repeat. This CD represents the second repeat of Ub-E1.</td>

            <td id=al>Ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), repeat 1-like. E1, a highly conserved small protein present universally in eukaryotic cells, is part of cascade to attach ubiquitin (Ub) covalently to substrate proteins. This cascade consists of activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and/or ligating (E3) enzymes and then targets them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. E1 activates ubiquitin by C-terminal adenylation, and subsequently forms a highly reactive thioester bond between its catalytic cysteine and ubiquitin's C-terminus. The E1 also associates with E2 and promotes ubiquitin transfer to the E2's catalytic cysteine. A set of novel molecules with a structural similarity to Ub, called Ub-like proteins (Ubls), have similar conjugation cascades. In contrast to ubiquitin-E1, which is a single-chain protein with a weakly conserved two-fold repeat, many of the Ubls-E1are a heterodimer where each subunit corresponds to one half of a single-chain E1. This CD represents the family homologous to the first repeat of Ub-E1.</td>
