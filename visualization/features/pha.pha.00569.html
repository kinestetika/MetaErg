            <td id=al>hydroxylamine reductase. This model represents a family of proteins containing an unusual 4Fe-2S-2O hydrid cluster. Earlier reports had proposed a 6Fe-6S prismane cluster. This subfamily is heterogeneous with respect to the presence or absence of a region of about 100 amino acids not far from the N-terminus of the protein. Members have been described as monomeric. The general function is unknown, although members from E. coli and several other species have hydroxylamine reductase activity. Members are found in various bacteria, in Archaea, and in several parasitic eukaryotes: Giardia intestinalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Entamoeba histolytica.

            <td id=al>Hybrid cluster protein (HCP), formerly known as prismane, is thought to play a role in nitrogen metabolism but its specific function is unknown. HCP has three structural domains, an N-terminal alpha-helical domain, and two similar domains comprising a central beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices. HCP contains two iron-sulfur clusters, one of which is a [Fe4-S4] cubane cluster similar to that of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH).  The second cluster, referred to as the hybrid cluster, is a hybrid [Fe4-S2-O2] center located at the interface of the three domains. Although the hybrid cluster is buried within the protein, it is accessible through a large hydrophobic cavity.</td>

            <td id=al>Prismane/CO dehydrogenase family. This family includes both hybrid-cluster proteins and the beta chain of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. The hybrid-cluster proteins contain two Fe/S centers - a [4Fe-4S] cubane cluster, and a hybrid [4Fe-2S-2O] cluster. The physiological role of this protein is as yet unknown, although a role in nitrate/nitrite respiration has been suggested. The prismane protein from Escherichia coli was shown to contain hydroxylamine reductase activity (NH2OH + 2e + 2 H+ -> NH3 + H2O). This activity is rather low. Hydroxylamine reductase activity was also found in CO-dehydrogenase in which the active site Ni was replaced by Fe. The CO dehydrogenase contains a Ni-3Fe-2S-3O centre.</td>

            <td id=al>The HCP family of iron-sulfur proteins includes hybrid cluster protein (HCP), acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), all of which contain [Fe4-S4] metal clusters at their active sites. These proteins have a conserved alpha-beta rossman fold domain. HCP, formerly known as prismane, is thought to play a role in nitrogen metabolism but its specific function is unknown.  Acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), is found in acetogenic and methanogenic organisms and is responsible for the synthesis and breakdown of acetyl-CoA. ACS forms a heterotetramer with carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) consisting of two ACS and two CODH subunits. CODH reduces carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and ACS then synthesizes acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide and CoA.</td>

            <td id=al>Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) is found in acetogenic and methanogenic organisms and is responsible for the synthesis and breakdown of acetyl-CoA, respectively. CODH has two types of metal clusters, a cubane [Fe4-S4] center (B-cluster) similar to that of hybrid cluster protein (HCP) and a Ni-Fe-S center (C-cluster) where carbon monoxide oxidation occurs.  Bifunctional CODH forms a heterotetramer with acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) consisting of two CODH and two ACS subunits while monofunctional CODH forms a homodimer. Bifunctional CODH reduces carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and ACS then synthesizes acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide, CoA, and a methyl group donated by another protein (CoFeSP), while monofunctional CODH oxidizes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. CODH and ACS each have a metal cluster referred to as the C- and A-clusters, respectively.</td>
