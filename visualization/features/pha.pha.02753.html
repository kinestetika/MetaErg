Lyase class I_like superfamily of enzymes that catalyze beta-elimination reactions and are active as homotetramers. The four active sites of the homotetrameric enzyme are each formed by residues from three different subunits. This superfamily contains the lyase class I family, histidine ammonia-lyase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. The lyase class I family comprises proteins similar to class II fumarase, aspartase, adenylosuccinate lyase, argininosuccinate lyase, and 3-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme which, for the most part catalyze similar beta-elimination reactions in which a C-N or C-O bond is cleaved with the release of fumarate as one of the products. Histidine or phenylalanine ammonia-lyase catalyze a beta-elimination of ammonia from histidine and phenylalanine, respectively.</td>

            <td id=al>cd01359 Argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinase, ASAL). This group contains ASAL and related proteins. It is a member of the Lyase class I family. Members of this family for the most part catalyze similar beta-elimination reactions in which a C-N or C-O bond is cleaved with the release of fumarate as one of the products. These proteins are active as tetramers. The four active sites of the homotetrameric enzyme are each formed by residues from three different subunits. ASAL is a cytosolic enzyme which catalyzes the reversible breakdown of argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate during arginine biosynthesis. In ureotelic species ASAL also catalyzes a reaction involved in the production of urea. Included in this group are the major soluble avian eye lens proteins from duck, delta 1 and delta 2 crystallin. Of these two isoforms only delta 2 has retained ASAL activity. These crystallins may have evolved by, gene recruitment of ASAL followed by gene duplication. In humans, mutations in ASAL result in the autosomal recessive disorder argininosuccinic aciduria.</td>

The full-length protein forms a tetramer with visible globular shape. FumaraseC_C is the C-terminal 65 residues referred to as domain 3. The core of the molecule consists of a bundle of 20 alpha-helices from the five-helix bundle of domain 2. The projections from the core of the tetramer are generated from domains 1 and 3 of each subunit. FumaraseC_C does not appear to be part of either the active site or the activation site but is helical in structure forming a little bundle.</td>

CMLE catalyzes the cyclization of 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate (3CM) to 4-carboxy-muconolactone in the beta-ketoadipate pathway. This pathway is responsible for the catabolism of a variety of aromatic compounds into intermediates of the citric cycle in prokaryotic and eukaryotic micro-organisms.</td>

Members of this family for the most part catalyze similar beta-elimination reactions in which a C-N or C-O bond is cleaved with the release of fumarate as one of the products. These proteins are active as tetramers. The four active sites of the homotetrameric enzyme are each formed by residues from three different subunits. ASL catalyzes two steps in the de novo purine biosynthesis: the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole-(N-succinylocarboxamide) ribotide (SAICAR) into 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and; the conversion of adenylsuccinate (SAMP) into adenosine monophosphate (AMP). pCMLE catalyzes the cyclization of 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate (3CM) to 4-carboxy-muconolactone, in the beta-ketoadipate pathway. ASL deficiency has been linked to several pathologies including psychomotor retardation with autistic features, epilepsy and muscle wasting.</td>
