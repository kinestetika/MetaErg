            <td id=al>lactoylglutathione lyase. Lactoylglutathione lyase is also known as aldoketomutase and glyoxalase I. Glyoxylase I is a homodimer in many species. In some eukaryotes, including yeasts and plants, the orthologous protein carries a tandem duplication, is twice as long, and hits this model twice.

            <td id=al>Glyoxalase I that uses Ni(++) as cofactor. This family includes Escherichia coil and other prokaryotic glyoxalase I that uses nickel as cofactor. Glyoxalase I (also known as lactoylglutathione lyase; EC 4.4.1.5) is part of the glyoxalase system, a two-step system for detoxifying methylglyoxal, a side product of glycolysis. This system is responsible for the conversion of reactive, acyclic alpha-oxoaldehydes into the corresponding alpha-hydroxyacids and involves 2 enzymes, glyoxalase I and II. Glyoxalase I catalyses an intramolecular redox reaction of the hemithioacetal (formed from methylglyoxal and glutathione) to form the thioester, S-D-lactoylglutathione. This reaction involves the transfer of two hydrogen atoms from C1 to C2 of the methylglyoxal, and proceeds via an ene-diol intermediate. Glyoxalase I has a requirement for bound metal ions for catalysis. Eukaryotic glyoxalase I prefers the divalent cation zinc as cofactor, whereas Escherichia coil and other prokaryotic glyoxalase I uses nickel. However, eukaryotic Trypanosomatid parasites also use nickel as a cofactor, which could possibly be explained by acquiring their GLOI gene by horizontal gene transfer. Human glyoxalase I is a two-domain enzyme and  it has the structure of a domain-swapped dimer with two active sites located at the dimer interface. In yeast, in various plants, insects and Plasmodia, glyoxalase I is four-domain, possibly the result of a further gene duplication and an additional gene fusing event.</td>

Uncharacterized subfamily of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily contains human glyoxalase domain-containing protein 4 and similar proteins. VOC  is composed of structurally related proteins with paired beta.alpha.beta.beta.beta motifs that provide a metal coordination environment with two or three open or readily accessible coordination sites to promote direct electrophilic participation of the metal ion in catalysis. VOC domain is found in a variety of structurally related metalloproteins, including the bleomycin resistance protein, glyoxalase I, and type I ring-cleaving dioxygenases. A bound metal ion is required for protein activities for the members of this superfamily. A variety of metal ions have been found in the catalytic centers of these proteins including Fe(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Ni(II) and Mg(II). The protein superfamily contains members with or without domain swapping. The proteins of this family share three conserved metal binding amino acids with the type I extradiol dioxygenases, which shows no domain swapping.</td>

            <td id=al>vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) family. The vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily is composed of structurally related proteins with paired beta.alpha.beta.beta.beta motifs that provide a metal coordination environment with two or three open or readily accessible coordination sites to promote direct electrophilic participation of the metal ion in catalysis. VOC is found in a variety of structurally related metalloproteins, including the type I extradiol dioxygenases, glyoxalase I and a group of antibiotic resistance proteins. A bound metal ion is required for protein activities for the members of this superfamily. A variety of metal ions have been found in the catalytic centers of these proteins including Fe(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Ni(II) and Mg(II). Type I extradiol dioxygenases catalyze the incorporation of both atoms of molecular oxygen into aromatic substrates, which results in the cleavage of aromatic rings. They are key enzymes in the degradation of aromatic compounds. Type I extradiol dioxygenases include class I and class II enzymes. Class I and II enzymes show sequence similarity; the two-domain class II enzymes evolved from a class I enzyme through gene duplication. Glyoxylase I catalyzes the glutathione-dependent inactivation of toxic methylglyoxal, requiring zinc or nickel ions for activity. The antibiotic resistance proteins in this family use a variety of mechanisms to block the function of antibiotics. Bleomycin resistance protein (BLMA) sequesters bleomycin's activity by directly binding to it. Whereas, three types of fosfomycin resistance proteins employ different mechanisms to render fosfomycin inactive by modifying the fosfomycin molecule. Although the proteins in this superfamily are functionally distinct, their structures are similar. The difference among the three dimensional structures of the three types of proteins in this superfamily is interesting from an evolutionary perspective. Both glyoxalase I and BLMA show domain swapping between subunits. However, there is no domain swapping for type 1 extradiol dioxygenases.</td>

MMCE has been found in bacteria, archaea, and in animals. In eukaryotes, MMCE is an essential enzyme in a pathway that converts propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, and is important in the breakdown of odd-chain length fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, and other metabolites. In bacteria, MMCE participates in the reverse pathway for propionate fermentation, glyoxylate regeneration, and the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics. MMCE is closely related to glyoxalase I and type I extradiol dioxygenases.</td>
