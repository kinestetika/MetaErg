            <td id=al>C-terminal helicase domain of the RecQ family helicases. The RecQ helicase family is an evolutionarily conserved class of enzymes, dedicated to preserving genomic integrity by operating in telomere maintenance, DNA repair, and replication. They are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA. This model describes the C-terminal domain, also called HelicC.</td>

The Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SNF) family includes chromatin-remodeling factors, such as CHD proteins and SMARCA proteins, recombination proteins Rad54, and many others. They are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases.

            <td id=al>C-terminal helicase domain of the endoribonuclease Dicer. Dicer ribonucleases cleave double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors to generate microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In concert with Argonautes, these small RNAs bind complementary mRNAs to down-regulate their expression. miRNAs are processed by Dicer from small hairpins, while siRNAs are typically processed from longer dsRNA, from endogenous sources, or exogenous sources such as viral replication intermediates. Some organisms, such as Homo sapiens and Caenorhabditis elegans, encode one Dicer that generates miRNAs and siRNAs, but other organisms have multiple dicers with specialized functions. Dicer exists throughout eukaryotes, and a subset has an N-terminal helicase domain of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) subgroup. RLRs often function in innate immunity and Dicer helicase domains sometimes show differences in activity that correlate with roles in immunity. Dicer helicase domains are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA. This model describes the C-terminal domain, also called HelicC.</td>

            <td id=al>C-terminal helicase domain of Fanconi anemia group M family helicases. Fanconi anemia group M (FANCM) protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex. It is required for the normal activation of the FA pathway, leading to monoubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex in response to DNA damage, cellular resistance to DNA cross-linking drugs, and prevention of chromosomal breakage. Hef (helicase-associated endonuclease fork-structure) belongs to the XPF/MUS81/FANCM family of endonucleases and is involved in stalled replication fork repair. FANCM and Hef are DEAD-like helicases belonging to superfamily (SF)2, a diverse family of proteins involved in ATP-dependent RNA or DNA unwinding. Similar to SF1 helicases, SF2 helicases do not form toroidal structures like SF3-6 helicases. Their helicase core consists of two similar protein domains that resemble the fold of the recombination protein RecA. This model describes the C-terminal domain, also called HelicC.</td>
